I don't really know how to write this.

First I wrote with an example of "bronies". Relatively speaking, not super serious. Alienation because your identity is based around a show whose target audience was not you, but then a bunch of you become the main audience of a show. Reactionism is the strongest western driving force, so it's no wonder.

Then I was thinking of the alienation within bronies because of the term itself is for primarily adult males (you can guess its etymology). Some people still used "brony" but some started using "pegasisters" or just "pony fans" instead, which itself causes alienation because of gender and power imbalances in current society, and the power of labelling and stuff.

And then I was thinking of indigenous people because even though it's a much more serious thing, it's kind of the opposite; you remove the labels they had prescribed themselves to induce assimilation into a group, yet the barrier of culture mitigates the catalysis of assimilation, and as such become devoid of their identity. This obviously made me think of just race in general after.

And then I ultimately thought of gender/sexuality, because the normalisation of being cis/hetero (naturally as a result of the proportion of people who are cis/hetero) is a simple analogous example to how racial erasure drives alienation; however, the drive to add further labels and categorisations within the realm of gender and sexuality causes a similar yet much more intense and worse form of alienation to the alienation seen within brony culture.

So really this brought me to a conclusion:
Alienation is simply an attack on one's identity

To erase one's identity is alienation
To ostracise one from a group because of another group is alienation
To identify yourself with
