        <h1 class="title">Web Development Services</h1>
        <p>Apparently people want to pay for me to make their website LOL, so I made this page for more info on that</p>
        <br>
        <p>I have 3 tiers to go off of as ballpark prices <strong>(for reference)</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple portfolio/info site <strong>(500-1500 CAD)</strong></li>
            <li>Business site with forms and interactivity <strong>(1500-3500 CAD)</strong></li>
            <li>E-commerce or server-based features <strong>(3500+ CAD)</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>For reference, if u asked me to make my own entire website again, I'd make it in <strong>~2250 CAD</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Every project is different for sure, and some people have unique needs. Just get in touch with me in however way you want from the bottom of my <a href="/contact">contact page</a> and we can discuss for an actual price. I expect payment to be provided before the final iteration of the website goes live.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>After the final delivery (the website is built and deployed and there are no initial requirements), I will give it to you for full control, and it will be completely out of my hands.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>If ongoing maintenance/updates are needed (such as you want me to add something else later), then it will be <strong>billed hourly at a rate of 125 CAD/hr.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>I can also recommend hosting and editing platforms and tools to make it easier for you to edit and make simple changes yourself too <strong>without extra cost.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Again, to contact me, please visit the <a href="/contact">contact page</a>. My email/other contact methods are there.</p>
