As a child, Rose loved flowers. All which Rose ever knew of were flowers. Unbeknownst to her parents, Rose would undertake a strong fascination to her name and spend all of her free time immersing herself into the world of flowers.

Funnily enough, her favourite flower is not a rose, or even a red flower at all. Her fascination was mainly driven towards hollyhocks, with their concave petal shape, surrounding and covering the core bright yellow part of their flowers.

“Rose, it’s time to leave now my dear,” an unfamiliar voice says. It was the final memory she had of the place she once knew. An otherworldly sight of a pathway with large openings on one side showcasing a blue sky and clouds underneath while letting the gusts of wind come and go. The path was covered with black hollyhocks among luscious grass, but she seemingly could not remember where such a place was or led to.

She wasn’t even sure if such a place was real either. After all, it seems so unrealistic for it to be so high up in the sky. All of the interrogation efforts on her family and close friends, and her research had led to no discernable path in sight, as if she was the only person to have ever witnessed such a place. Everything suggests that it was just a figment of her imagination, yet she couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something missing.

Unfortunately, her recalling of memories was interrupted.

“Hello Madam, would you like some tea, or coffee?” The attendant asked.

“Oh, tea please. Thank you dear.”

As busy as business gets, Rose was flying from her home town in Germany to the US for a meeting her company was holding. The company in question was a large tea manufacturing company she created herself called Sinensis. When looking into Camellia flowers as a young child, the production of tea with one type of them had piqued her interest, and she seemed to have figured out the processes to a T, allowing her to harness and refine the skill, and formed the company, allowing her to make a fortune at a young age. Though, she is much older now.

“Here you go. Enjoy your drink!”

“Oh thank you so much.”

She was delighted. Immediately, she could tell this was her tea, and not a competitors. Oddly enough she is only flying economy, though it doesn’t pose much of an issue as asking someone on the street who the owner of the company was would probably leave almost anyone hanging, and she isn’t much of a public figure herself.

“How’s the tea?” A man beside her asks.

“Oh it’s just wonderful. I love Sinensis Orange Pekoe, it works just perfectly for me.”

“Ah, so they have Sinensis tea. My wife loves that a lot. The aroma reminds her of a flower field.”

She grins feeling a small sense of achievement, though nothing new for her.

“I haven’t really tried much of it myself, just a coffee drinker mainly,” he continues, “Plus it doesn’t really help me for my workouts like coffee does either.”

“Ah, well you are a fit young man. You have a great life ahead of you!”

Indeed, the man seemed to be in his late 20s to early 30s, and seemed to be in very good shape.

“Haha, thank you I work on it a lot. I’m actually a fitness trainer for my local gym in America. i actually just finished visiting Germany to meet my extended family over here.”

“Oh, how was Germany? Lived here all my life.”

“Oh it’s great it’s great. I like the driving and general feel of America more though.”

“Interesting. I work at a floral shop in Germany and I tend to like the closeness feeling of everything Germany provides more than how America is in my travels.”

Working at a floral shop is her go to cover up, though not necessarily a lie per-se as she does help work for one in her spare time.

“Ah. Yeah it’s probably just a cultural difference.”

The conversation didn’t really continue on from there and she soon fell fast asleep as the plane takes off near midnight.

…

Around 6–7 hours later, she wakes up and notices the man who was sitting beside him gone. As she was sitting on the window seat, she decides to peek outside, but she is instead greeted with a blinding light of sun as she tried to open the window. Closing it again, she takes in her surroundings, with most windows closed and the inner light of the plane still on.

The flight attendant passes by and she just so has the idea to ask

“Excuse me, do you know where the man who was sitting beside me may have gone?”

“Um, ma’am I don’t exactly remember who was sitting here sorry.”

Curious as to where he may have gone, but not curious enough to actively look for him, she decided to just leave it there, and instead pull out and open a leather binder to start writing notes for the meeting.

This meeting was meant to be focused on expansion into health sectors, and expansion into the US as well. While some exports to the US had already begun, she wishes to focus towards competing with US-based tea manufacturing companies to have a greater edge.

A bit later, the man comes back to his seat, opposite of the direction the nearest washroom is.

“Hello again dear.”

“Hello. You finally woke up! How was your sleep?”

“I slept well, it was a very tiring day yesterday and I got some good hours in.”

“Good to hear. Say I wanted to ask, what was the Floral Shop you worked at called?”

She froze for a split second before answering, “Oh it’s just a side shop called die Rose Blüten. No-one really knows the name. Do you want directions to the location or…”

“Oh no no no, I was just wondering because I don’t really know any floral shopkeepers at all you know.”

A while later, he gets up again and heads toward the opposite direction of the bathroom again. She didn’t seem to notice either time as she was more invested into writing her notes. The expansion opportunities were very important for her final goal.

He comes back.

“Hey, I just wanted to ask, are you sure you work at a floral shop called die Rose Blüten?”

She froze, this time for much longer, “Um… yes? Why are you asking this?”

“I have a feeling that that may not be the case,” he says as he pulls out 2 bags, “do not raise your voice, I will explode this plane if you don’t listen and do as I say.”

Shocked, Rose is frozen in place and in bewilderment. Of course something like this was bound to happen, but she never took it seriously.

“W-what did I do? what do you… from me exactly? If you need money just ask…”

“We want you out of the US. We don’t need your business anywhere near here,” he states in a strict manner, “in that meeting you’re going to, you are going to ensure that this company never expands here, and that it will leave its current stay here as soon as possible. You can’t be hurting our profits.”

“I-is that all this is? Your profits? Maybe we could work a deal out? I do-”

“Listen, your company’s goals are not ones that any of us would like to work with. You and your company are going to leave as we are telling you.”

“… I’ll see if I can”

“You won’t see if you can, you will see it done.”

“…”

The man left again in the same direction he came from, and she never saw him again in the flight.

She felt a mix of worry and anger, why would they succumb to such ridiculous measures for preserving simple profits she thought, outrageous.

Once the flight landed, she decided she did not care for the threat she was just recently subjugated to, thinking she was know invincible from any tragedy to occur.

She called and ordered 24/7 security for her stay period, and conducted the meeting as initially planned. The company will continue their expansion projects and she approves to see the completion of them.

At the night of, Rose lay in her bed, thinking about the many decades of life she had spent working on multiple flower projects. All her life, she had dedicated to anything that was related to flowers, all in order to see that place at least one more time.

As she continued to lay, it all felt more and more fruitless and empty to her. As she had gotten quite old, her hope for seeing the place she wishes waned, wondering more and more if she will even be able to live long enough to get the chance to see it. Intoxicated all her life from the vision, she put tons of work to be able to get to circumstances which she initially guessed would have made it easier, but all to no avail.

After a while of these thoughts rampaging and plaguing her conscious mind, she falls asleep.

There, she sees it again for the second time in her entire life.

The vision she hoped for, was right in front of her eyes.

The walls were just as she remembered, white and clean. Huge openings on one side, with a hard wall on the other. Looking below through an opening, there were clouds as far as the eye could see, and a clear sky above. The pathway was narrow, but with the luscious green grass and the black hollyhocks just as she remembered.

It was all so sudden and real for her. She can’t believe what her eyes were seeing. Running through, she tries to see what may be at the end of the path, but it seemed as if there was no end, nor a beginning. All in all, it was just this path that she had envisioned, of which she was now presumably suddenly stuck on.

She then realizes.

“Rose, it’s time to leave now my dear,” an unfamiliar voice says.
