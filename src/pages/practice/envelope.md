A door.. all there really was in front of me was just a door. It was a bit far, and I couldn’t exactly tell that it was a door, but it had the dark silhouette of one at the very least.

Nothing else really was there for me to see, it was all so pitch dark my sense of perception couldn’t tell if there were any walls, or if there was any flooring at all. I did however notice though, that underneath my feet was a bright square.

I started to wonder if there was any more of the floor than what I was just standing on, or if I was just stranded on this square and everywhere around me was just a bottomless pit. After a bit, I decided to try and take a step, hoping I didn’t fall. Fortunately, I didn’t, and another square lit up around the foot I just placed.

I then wondered if I could reach a wall of this place at all, so I slowly took steps to the right, and gradually picked up the pace. After a while, I gave up and walked towards the left instead.

But I made a mistake.

My only frame of reference was the door, but now that I went so far right, I couldn’t exactly see that door at all anymore, so all I saw around me was just pitch black, and the bright square under me.

My orientation started to falter, and at some point, I fell. After a while, I kept falling. If it weren’t for the bright squares, I probably would have lost my sense of vertical direction at some point too.

By a stroke of luck, I was able to have the door within my frame of vision again, and based on what had happened on the right side, I decided not to venture too far to the left to avoid the same issue again.

Coming back to the door, I noticed that on the other side of the door, it was all pitch black, with no white outline of a door and handle. Going through the door on this side didn’t physically stop me at all, but when I turned to look back, the white outline was there. I also couldn't physically go through the door from this side.

What was more troubling though, was that the door was locked.

At first, I was amused. I was amused for a long while in fact. “A trippy escape room,” I thought to myself, as my mind tried to wonder what this could all mean. The handle didn’t seem to have a keyhole of any sort that I could tell, so my first thought was to do something in this room to unlock it

Unfortunately, I came to realize very quickly that the number of possibilities are endless. While the place is vast and empty with nothing but a door and a bright square under me, there could be countless things that could be done even with just these 3 things.

At this point, panic started to set in. Solely because of a hypothetical msde in my head. Naïve to think in the first place that orienting and of the 3 visible entities here would even affect the circumstance at all, but it was the first thing my mind grabbed onto, so it must have been the case!

I sat there in confusion and worry. I had started to think about how and why I had gotten here in the first place, and what could possibly be the reason why I would be put in such a torturous position. My clothes were all pitch black as well. I had no idea what to make of all this…

Was this even real life? I asked myself. I pinched myself, and since it hurt I thought it must be, which meant that thirst and starvation must be just around the corner.

The panic increased. As I thought of more and more worrying circumstances related to my current position, less and less focus was put into the situation, and I began to lose sanity. All attempts at calming myself were failing

It’s over. This is all a mess. Am I going to die here in a slow and painful death from starvation?

The thoughts came, and the thoughts stayed.

…

An indefinite amount of time passes. I lay on the ground, exhausted from the despair, the frustration, the worry, the grief. It seemed like it had been ages, but at the very least, the hunger and thirst hadn’t kicked in, so it must’ve not been so long.

I look around while I lay, even though there was nothing to look at aside for the silhouette of a door. The floor felt very warm, and a bit soft even, as if I was laying on a bed of grass outside in a warm night. I started imagining the light like the moon, reflecting the sun’s light onto me with its beautiful rays. Thinking about it for a split second more, I looked towards what would be the ceiling or sky, but there was nothing there.

Laying on the floor was still uncomfortable, so I got up and looked at the door again. After a while I gave up once again and cried myself to exhaustion.

But…

Once the capacity of crying and becoming exhausted was depleted, I noticed that my foot was through the door. Immediately, I was ecstatic. My way out! I thought to myself, as I pushed myself through the door while I lay on the floor. I noticed however, that the floor did not shine brightly in the other side of the door, but didn’t think much of it.

Unfortunately, the moment I had passed through the entire door, the floor suddenly disappeared, and I was in free fall. I was confused and angry, but also tremendously frightened. Will this fall be forever? Will I die hitting a floor at some point? It all was madness at this point. I couldn’t even think straight anymore, and I was unable to tell top to bottom, left to right. At the very least the door and the floor anchored my senses before, but now it’s a complete disarray.

Within another indefinite amount of time, I continued to fall. It seemed like there was going to be no end, and that I will die as I fall. I cried, and pondered in grief, thinking about the things I had done, the regrets I had made, the confusion of how I got here, and the hopelessness of getting out. I wished that I had done more for so many of the projects I wanted to start, and so many of the projects that I wanted to continue to completion, but alas, it was meant to be over at this state.

It felt like years before I had accepted my circumstances of endlessly falling. I was at peace in knowing this is how it would all end for me, and I took it as is. Thinking about more smaller regrets at this point, I began thinking about how I regret not playing Dark Souls 3 before this, and how I was not able to try the greatest food indian-japenese restaurants had to offer…

and then it hit me…

I’m still not hungry or thirsty…

It was definitely more than a month, but I couldn’t exactly tell for sure…

Suddenly… my flailing, falling body hit a floor at terminal velocity, and my consciousness instantly vanished.

And then I woke up.
