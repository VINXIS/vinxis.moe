<span style="color:red;">THIS IS ALL FRESH OFF THE PEN AND PAPER. ALSO uhhh the name's are just random letters rn because of reasons</span>

Also the colours don't mean anything aside for just differentiating them more easily

---

A partly cloudy day. The sun peeks and leaves as the time passes. The wind breezes as it lays with its eyes closed. The grass is just tall enough to cover it from normal view.

Serenity and peace. Just the usual. It lays without a care in the world. Ran around with its friends earlier this morning, then fed real well by its parents earlier. Now, it just wants to take in its environment and relax.

From time to time, it itches its ears when they get perked up by the bristling grass. Although not quite common, it managed to avoid the many variations of birth defects possible for its kind. A beautiful mix of hair for the ears and head give it a defining beauty that some of its friends lack. Clear skin, with no odd patches of fur growth. No whiskers. Teeth only slightly unaligned at worse. Quite the lottery it won when it was born.

It lays, and takes in its surroundings. Not a thought or care about anything in the world... just the wind blowing, and the wonderous feeling of grass.

Though, it is short-lived. Someone comes near. It knows who is coming just by the gait, but says nothing.

"Heeeey <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span>," <span style="color: #b8860b;">y</span> shouts, as she comes near.

<span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> doesn't respond.

"Heyyyyyyyyyy... are you dead?"

Although it wasn't sleeping, it pretends to be half awake, grunting while conjuring its words, "eurhghhh... what do you want!!!! I'm sleeping!!!!!!!"

"We're gonna play hide and seek! Let's play hide and seek we're all playing!!!"

"ehhhh... don't wanna right now"

"Why nott!!!! Everyone's playinng!!!!! Even <span style="color: #8b4513;">z</span> is playing..."

"Okay but Idon'twannastopannoyingme..."

"Come onn we haven't been able to play with everyone in soooo longgg" <span style="color: #b8860b;">y</span> insists. It is true, it is quite the once in a lifetime the entire group is willing to play 1 single thing.

"I don't care!! Why did you guys pick noww...? When I just wanna sleep...? Everyone just hates me"

"<span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> pleaseee a lot of them won't play unless everyone is playing and that includes you"

"Ugh... why do you want everyone anyway??? Just play with... not everyone. You play hide and seek all the time anyway, it's all you do..."

"This is differeeeent... also HEY!!! I don't only play hide and seek all the time..." she pauses, "pleaaase? I'll do anything for you..."

"Shut up you keep none of your promises and you're annoying GO AWAYY"

"nnn...," <span style="color: #b8860b;">y</span> is about to start crying.

"...What? Why are you crying?" <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> is slightly startled. Not the usual sight for sure, "...what the heck? Are you okay?"

<span style="color: #b8860b;">y</span> doesn't respond, as she tries to hold her tears back.

<span style="color: #009d36;">x</span>, concerned, slowly gets up to try to face <span style="color: #b8860b;">y</span>, "...Um... okay well... I'll come play hide and seek..."

<span style="color: #b8860b;">y</span> doesn't exactly feel a lot much better, but she says "sniff... really?"

"Yes... ugh so stupid"

"...Okay... don't call it stupid... but thank you..."

"...whatever, sure sorry"

They walk back without talking; the only sound between them is the seldom sniffling of <span style="color: #b8860b;">y</span>'s, gradually decreasing as they walk back to the villa. <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> was quite far away from the area, so they were walking back for a good few minutes. The plains are massive, but the defining line is clear by the environment. By the time the reach the shaded area from the massive coniferous trees surrounding the villa, <span style="color: #b8860b;">y</span>'s sniffling had stopped entirely.

The heart of the young soul is weak, and will succumb to anything. 

The shade is great at keeping the villa area cool. The sun only truly shines for a couple hours at noon as the trees are too tall for the sun to peer through for the rest of the day; however, it's fortunately never too dark in the villa during the day. The habitants are always able to go through their day with no issues. The 2 of them walk through the villa as the adults around are busy with their own happenings, and with each other. As expected, many of them are talking about daily activities: what to cook for dinner, how hobbies are going, means to handle their grooming and such, so on and so forth.

At some point in the villa they reach the group. A few are overjoyed, while a few are annoyed.

"Oh man why is he back?" <span style="color: #8b4513;">z</span> says, "I don't wanna *actually* play hide and seek..."

"Sucks for you girl, guess you gotta play now", says <span style="color: #4682b4;">a</span>.

"Okay...but so do you..."

"Well I do wanna play so"

"grrRRR stop showing off just because you're older than us..."

"I'm NOT doing THAT???"

"Everyoneee stop itt... let's just play already I'm boored," says <span style="color: #9932cc;">b</span>, who is visibly irritated because they had to wait for what feels like eons to a child.

"Okay... who's it?" says <span style="color: #4682b4;">a</span>

"Just choose yourself... *you* are the chosen one!!" says <span style="color: #8b4513;">z</span>

"What?!"

"Stop fighting!! Let's just go with <span style="color: #4682b4;">a</span> as the one who's it..." <span style="color: #b8860b;">y</span> interjects. Her face is still a bit puffy from the crying she was trying so desparately to hold earlier.

"Hey are you okay? Did <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> hit you?" <span style="color: #8b4513;">z</span> says, "i don't like you all..."

"I did not... what the heck? She just starte-" <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> tries to defend itself before <span style="color: #b8860b;">y</span> interjects, "I'M OKAY. LET'S JUST PLAYY..."

Everyone is quiet for a few seconds before <span style="color: #4682b4;">a</span> says, "Okay.... okay I'll start counting now to 60 because that's a full minute if some of you forgot! Again everyone, you can hide in the forest, but you can't hide in the plains grass that's not fai-"

"WE KNOWWW LET'S GO!!!!!" a few of them say.

And after what felt like forever to everyone... they all run away to their own little worlds to start the game of hide and seek. <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> looks back at <span style="color: #4682b4;">a</span> as she has her eyes closed facing the wall of a neighbour's little house. It thinks about how long it's going to have to hide, as <span style="color: #4682b4;">a</span> doesn't particularly have the greatest skills for finding them...

Hide and seek never really finishes, because it's almost impossible for everyone to be found. The group at full capacity is a lofty 50 kids. Might as well be the entire villa's child population. With that, the entire villa is up for grabs as a hiding spot, as well as the forest, and the forest is *vast*. While it's full of solely rows and rows of massively tall trees, the rows themselves go on for what feels like forever.

Fortunately, some of these kids are born with some "superior" defects... some of them can see much better than others, some of them can sniff out others more easily, and some of them have amazing hearing. As a result, even though the environment theoretically would make it impossible for everyone to be caught, these abilities allow the very rare chance for it to actually occur.

...

Unfortunately for this game, <span style="color: #4682b4;">a</span> has none of those... in fact, her eyes are so INCREDIBLY weak that she could be considered blind. <span style="color: #b8860b;">y</span> wasn't really thinking much when she just agreed and went along with <span style="color: #8b4513;">z</span>'s taunts towards <span style="color: #4682b4;">a</span>.

They're not really thinking much about it in general though since they know what to expect. It's no wonder why the game is quite polarizing with the kids. <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> itself is groaning at the idea as to how long it's going to be hiding now...

Whenever <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> plays hide and seek, it goes to the woods, just like most of them. The woods is far more interesting to the kids, let's them adventure around. The hide and seek at best is simply an excuse, the real point is for the adventure.

...an adventure that gets boring after so many times...

But this takes the entire day, so there's lots of area to cover, and the forest has much to provide. One time, <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> and a small group of kids had found a massive cave system, but did not dare go in it. Another time they found a massive worn down building that was fully gated off with massive fields surrounding it, all within the forest... Another time they found a massive tower that was making weird sounds as they approached closer to it. None of the kids were really sure what it was, and when they told the parents, the parents just laughed it off thinking their imagination was running on overdrive.

None of the adults or even teens really ventured into the forest. The hide and seek was novel in this way, letting these kids do whatever. Initially, the parents were concerned, but the old man gave it a pass. He's the one who's been around since forever, so everyone just takes his word for it. And really, there hasn't been any casualties in the forest anyway. The old man was right, it's completely safe.

<span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> was grumbling and grunting about how it's going to have to hide for another eternity, and it can't even hide in the field. The field is it's favourite spot due to how tranquil the spot is to it. Doing the same thing in the forest feels much more mundane, with the wind having severely limited access in the area.

As it kept thinking about how annoying the next few hours will be, it suddenly forgot what it was thinking, as it realized it stumbled at a new place it's not seen...

The forest was still quite dense... but there are buildings. A lot of worn down, fallen buildings. It's like a farm of fallen buildings peppered across the dense rows of trees. Some of the trees were even growing through some of those buildings. <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> was surprised. It's never seen something like this yet... though anything anyone finds in the forest is truly unique. 

In the distance, it hears footsteps of dead branches.

"...OHHHHH MANNNN ARE YOU SERIOUS?" <span style="color: #8b4513;">z</span> exclaims from a distance.

"...What...?" <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> responds

"First you force me into the game by showing up, and now you take the first hiding spot I find? This sucks sooo much I don't wanna play anymoree..."

"You can just take this place... we can also just both take this place... there's so many hiding spots here"

"No I don't wanna be near you. I don't wanna be near ANYONE you all will just get me caught. I won't be able to explore then."

"What? There's so many hiding spots"

"You will be too near"

"This place is massive..."

"No"

"...why are you being annoying?"

"YOU are the annoying one here. Whatever you suck. See you later... you boys smell anyway"

"Hey WHAT? YOU suck man" but <span style="color: #8b4513;">z</span> already ran off, not hearing it at all.

Irritated by that, <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> decides to charge directly into one of the fallen buildings. Immediately after getting into one though, it hears a chunk of metal and steel fall to the ground from the upper side of the building. The irritation immediately was replaced with fright, but nevertheless, it decided to walk around the building.

It sees a long hallway with its floor covered in grass as the entire part of the building is flipped upside down. It notices signs and symbols that it has never recognized. It also noticed some random lights flashing here and there. Some of the doors seem to have an oscillating glowing yellow circle by them. As it kept walking, it reached an L corner of the hall only to be greeted with a natural dead-end, as a massive tree grew in the middle of the hallway, its trunk blocking the path compeltely.

Right beside it though, was a room that was somehow right side up. There was also a circle of light beside it that was different from the rest. It didn't oscillate, and it wasn't yellow... it couldn't really tell what colour it was... it was a more "deeper" colour than usual. <span style="color: #b8860b;">y</span> or <span style="color: #4682b4;">a</span> would know, since they can apparently see more colours... but well... it can't really ask either of them right now.

Curious getting the best of it however, it decides to try to open the door. There's a handle built in the door itself to slide, and it slide quite easily. When it opens the door however, it is greeted with a very blocked opening to the room. It supposedly connected to a room, but the building that room was in was shifted up. The opening to the room is quite small as a result needing to jump into the hole.

It decided to go in anyway, struggling a bit to get in. It did manage to succeed however. The room was dark, with only flashing LEDs illuminating the little they could. It was amazed by its surrounding, having never seen anything like it. Looking around, it also notices a very faint blue glow behind a door. Reaching its hand out, the wall suddenly moved in absurdly unnatural ways, collapsing onto itself to give way to an even smaller room. The smaller room gave out an insanely bright light, not letting you really see what's inside the room at all.

Startled at first, it decides to let the curiosity potentially kill it once more. It closes its eyes and walks into the next room. After walking in though it notices that the light suddenly disappeared. It opens its eyes, and notices only a light of soft ambience covering the room; however, a desk's cabinet also glows once more.

Of course...

it has to open that too..

When it opens it though, all it sees, is a cube

... or a box?

Is it a box or a cube?

I mean it seems like something you could put stuff in it though...

...

It reaches its hand out to it. 

Suddenly, it's enveloped by the light. Immediately after, a shockwave is sent, and the building collapses into dust almost entirely. 

Hours pass.

<span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> wakes up. It sees its parents and the old man in the old man's living room. 

...and it's time to pretend to be sleeping again...

...

The old man is talking.

"-ot tell anyone about this. As long as noone knows. Everything will be fine. They can know that he was hurt for a while, but that's it. What you saw is nothing of importance for you, and it's nothing of importance fo-"

"What? How is it not important to us? That was fucking insane?" <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> hears its mom... "You can't really expect us to just see that and just pretend like nothing fucking happened. You can't be serious gramps."

"Please calm down. We cannot do anything about it. Best believe... you will never see it again."

"HOW are you so sure? Why can't you just tell us?"

"Please. I need you kids to believe me. Nothing terrible has happened to this place for centuries. Please understand. I cannot tell you because I am not allowed to tell you."

"WHY are you not allowed to tell us?"

"I have vowed to protect all of you."

"Protect us better. You can protect us while still telling us don't be so fucking insidious about this, and using the excuse you told my grandparents for this is fucking disgusting."

"Listen.... <span style="color: #dc143c;">c</span>... you have to understand by now. You're an adult. There are so many reasons that you can figure out yourself as to why I can't just tell you. Think. Think for AT LEAST 2 SECONDS."

"I DON'T UNDERSTAND"

"OKAY... okay let's calm down. Here. Here's a simple reason: Once you know, the stability of the place will immediately dissolve. How? Well, I cannot tell you because of this reason."

"What?"

"Just calm down and think about it. I will repeat myself again if you want."

Minutes pass of nothing but various rates of breathing. As the minutes pass, the breathing rates synchronize.

"Okay. Sorry. I am just really unhappy about all of this."

"Please. Be rest assured. Your son is safe. I can assure you this. He is safe."

"I just... I just can't make myself believe it fully right now"

"What you saw needs time for you to process. As needed, I will meet with you everyday to help you as needed."

"...Fuck"

"I'm sorry. I'm sorry I can't tell you. Please. I'm not doing this because I want to."

"Can't you figure out a way to just tell us?"

"If there was a way, I would've found it already and told your grandparents."

"Okay. Okay I understand."

"..."

"Sorry. I should not have lost my control in front of you."

"It's alright <span style="color: #dc143c;">c</span>. I know it's tough."

As <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> had expected, dad said nothing.

No surprises.

Once again.

For <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> at least.

<span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> still feels exhausted though... it quickly loses its consciousness and falls back asleep.

---

<span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> knows something happened. It doesn't know what happened though. It doesn't feel like anything changed. It's body feels completely fine. No ideas come to mind. 

"What did I do?" it thought to itself, "What happened? How am I in my bed? I was in the forest? Is everyone back home? Am I okay? Why is mom so mad?" well the last one wasn't really a thought on its mind, mom ALWAYS gets angry...but still, strange...

"...I wanna get outta bed and meet friends" it finally thought. And then it did just that. Both parents weren't home when it woke up, probably out doing errands, so it wasn't able to talk to them today.

Leaving the house, it ran to where the usual group meets in the villa, and luckily saw the usual scenario. It was about to say hello alongside something about yesterday, but was immediately interrupted before even given the chance.

"HEY! Why did you disappear all day? You know we were allowed to just come back together after hide and seek was done right?" <span style="color: #ff8c00;">d</span> says.

"I... I didn't disappear..." <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> says, struggling to find the right words to say what happened.

"Are you.... okay?" says <span style="color: #4682b4;">a</span>

"...Yes, I think I feel just fine..."

"<span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> doesn't wanna play with us anymore, I always knew it..." said <span style="color: #8b4513;">z</span>.

"hey.. WHAT?"

"Come on <span style="color: #8b4513;">z</span> they didn't do it on purpose. You know this," said <span style="color: #ff8c00;">d</span>.

"WHY do I always have to get lectured by the older kids. It's always me," <span style="color: #8b4513;">z</span> retaliates.

"Come on, <span style="color: #8b4513;">z</span>, do you want ice cream or something?"

"Oh YES!!!!"

<span style="color: #8b4513;">z</span> and <span style="color: #ff8c00;">d</span> then immediately left together to get some. 

Always so hard to interact with <span style="color: #8b4513;">z</span>, <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> thought. 

"Does... does <span style="color: #8b4513;">z</span> hate me?" <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> asks <span style="color: #4682b4;">a</span>.

"No... she doesn't hate you. Don't worry <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span>. You did nothing wrong. You're a good boy."

"Hey, we aren't that much different in age!"

<span style="color: #4682b4;">a</span> giggles, "sorry sorry, I just like saying it. I want to be a mom when I grow up."

"Wow... let me come to the wedding!"

"Don't worry, you'll be my husband."

"hey... WHAT?"

"You don't like that?"

"I... I don't really want to be a husband..."

"Aw... I'm sorry <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span>"

"It's okay... I gotta go."

"Bye... sorry"

It ran off. It felt a bit weird from that, and it needed to take its mind off of it now; however, it didn't decide to go to the plains field.... it ran into the forest. It decided, it wanted to check the building again. It wanted to know what actually happened. What it looks like now. If there's any answers at all.

...

<span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> has really good directional memory even for its age. It can remember where to go back to any spot even if it went there only once before. Luckily, it comes real handy for now, as it finds the area with the fallen buildings again.

It saw the building.

It was obliterated. Only debris and dust remains.

...

There was another fallen building. <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> decides to go in and take a look. Maybe there's more to be found.

The building was eerily similar, but it doesn't register in <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span>'s mind. It does however feel a sense of deja vu as it passes though a very similar hallway. Rooms with different symbols and signs, but <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> can't tell the difference at all. When it reaches the corner of the L shape of the hallway, there was no tree to block it this time; however, there is nothing very interesting as it walks through the other part of the hallway.

None of the rooms in this building have any glowing lights though. It goes back to the room near the corner. The equivalent door in the other building had a light that it wasn't able to discern initially, so it decided to try going into this door here again.

Going through the door, this time the part of the building the room was in wasn't severely misaligned, making it quite easy to go in. There was much more light in this room than in the other one; however, there was nothing particularly interesting here. It looked around trying to see if there was anything interesting AT ALL, but found nothing.

In the end, it was empty handed.

...

It decided to try another building. The lights were off in the hallway for this new building as well.

...

No luck.

Disappointed, <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> decides to just go back, cross the villa, and lay in the plains. It's already exhausted anyway, a kid can only do so much thinking about its own existence, especially when it doesn't even know what happened.

However, it ran across <span style="color: #b8860b;">y</span> in the villa.

"Hiii!!! Wanna play?" <span style="color: #b8860b;">y</span> is excited to see <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> again after what feels like so long for her.

"Hey <span style="color: #b8860b;">y</span>... sorry I don't really wanna play or anything."

"Whaaat? That's too bad."

"Yea. Sorry."

"It's allll okay! In fact... I should say sorry for crying yesterday..."

"What? You don't need to apologize for that... I made you cry..."

"Noo you didn't <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span>! Don't worry! I love you sooo much~"

"Okay... if you say so... see you sooner or later"

"Bye!"

She runs away... to the forest... <span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> doesn't realize anything weird about that for a few seconds, until it remembers that <span style="color: #b8860b;">y</span> almost never goes to the forest by herself. One time, a tree had almost fell on her when she was by herself, and she was so scared since then she cried for hours while getting back home, and even at home she was devastated. She decided that day to never go to the forest alone after that.

<span style="color: #009d36;">x</span> was a bit worried... it wasn't too worried because in it's head nothing in the forest is really dangerous, without realizing the irony... but it was too fixated on the unexpected behaviour of <span style="color: #b8860b;">y</span>'s to think about it. 

...

It decided to follow her back into the forest once again, but with a distance.

<span style="color:red;">UHHH SOMETHING SOMETHIING IT fINDS HER AND SHES LIKE UHH WHAT THE HELL I DONT REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY IT GOES UHH WHAT THE HECK AND THEN IT GOES YEA THIS SHIT BLEW UP AND SHE GOES HIOLY MOLY!!!!! ALSO NEITHER OF THEM KNOW THAT BASICALLY SHE FOUND IT IN THE RUBBLE AND BROUGHT IT BACK HERSELF WITHOUT TELLING ANYONE ELSE CUZ SHES STUPID BABY CHILD IN THE FOREST AND YEA THAT SBASICALLY LIKE A BIT AFTER THE THING THAT HAPPENED IN THE VERY BEGINNING</span>

<span style="color:red;">idk about names man i mean i avhe ideas for names but idk im not thinking of it rn</span>
