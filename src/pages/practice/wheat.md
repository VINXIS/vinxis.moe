A clear, bright sunny day. An hour after sunrise, the sun shines and illuminates the bedroom with a glistening orange glow. One wakes up, and sees the wall shining by the sunlight, with the dust in the air visible through the path between the window and the wall. Another stays sleeping.

The first leaves the bed. The first thought comes.

"Time to freshen up".

Two sets of clothes and a towel are taken. Quickly and quietly, the house is left by the first. Going to the back of the house, and through the wilderness of dense tall trees, there is a stream of water falling from a log set slightly above. The sound of the wind blows, as leaves ruffle above. A chest is on the side, and the clothes are placed inside it. Above the chest is a makeshift rack, with a wooden cover on top. The towel is placed there. The combination of air and water relieves any tension that was once there. Soap is added to the mix, cleansing it all.

Drying up, one set of clothes and towel are left there for now. Leaving the wilderness, the first is back to the house, in the luscious front garden. The house is quite a small bungalow. Alongside it is a beautiful garden gate almost the same height as the house, covered with vines and plants, and separating the back and front from the side. Looking at the plants, it was decided then that breakfast would be a nice hash. Before breakfast though, the first leaves to the road, and walks to a neighbour's house. Right outside the house, there is a sign that says "Take as many as you want!" alongside a container filled with paper. A single sheet is taken.

Back in the house, the sheet is placed on a tabletop near the entrance. The second one is now awake, but still trying to sleep just a little longer. When the first walks back into the bedroom, the second stops trying to sleep and looks towards the first's direction for a slight bit, and then goes back to trying to sleep once again.

"mmmmmm......morin..."

"Morninnng! Do you want to sleep longer?"

"...mmmm..."

The first lightly chuckles, "Clothes in the bag as usual, sleep tight." The blinds are closed, cutting the sunlight off. 

"...tthanks"

"Love you."

The door is gently shut, and the next thought that comes is "time for breakfast".

Back at the garden, a variety of fruits and vegetables are publicly in display. The first picks up an onion plant, a potato, a few small tomatoes, and a pepper. 

A third walks by. The first exclaims, "YO!"

"Heyy! morning"

"Hey how's it goin"

"Quite well quite well. A nice clear sunny day today, made a lot of paper yesterday, about to go take a nice little shower.  How are you all doing?"

"Only I'm awake so far, prepping some breakfast! Already finished my shower and everythin."

"Nice... if I'm going to be honest though it feels like you're always doing most of the work in the house..."

"Naww I'm doing finee, sometimes one of us is just tired you know."

"It's been a LOONG time of you looking like you're doing most of the work..."

"...this honestly feels a bit to rude"

"oh... Oh sorry... I'm just worried a bit it's been a long while now..."

"It's fine. It's just how it is. Sometimes we are just completely tired and need someone else to take care of us."

"That is true... ..."

"Yea"

"...really I should've just asked if you needed any help or anything for me... do you need anything? Any plans today?"

"Ah, thanks, but not particularlyy... but now that you mention it... I was thinking of trying to go to the farm and get a bag of wheat. The house is sooo far though because the farmland is so massive, so I kind of didn't wanna bother"

"Oh! I was going there anyway. I can get you a bag while I'm there?"

"suree that would be great actually! What are you going there for?"

"A bag."

"Ah... well you can just take the bag if there aren't many left"

"No don't worry about it. You're working so hard and taking care of someone at the same time. I don't even really need it either. Even if you don't need it, just take it as a treat at the very least."

"ah... okay. Thanks,"

"Don't sweat it. I'll see you soon,"

"Love you"

"Love you too"

Picking up all the ingredients, it's cooking time. A nice aromatic hash is cooked, filling the house with a pleasant scent of food. The scent is so strong yet pleasant, waking up the second one, and coming out of the bedroom.

"nnnn..."

"...oh Morning! That was a quick nap!"

"nnyea"

"Come, let's eat it's fresh!"

The two sit, and the hash slowly but surely wakes the second one

"...ahhhhhh"

"Good?"

"itsgood,could use a bit more salt..."

"Ah true, let me get the salt shaker"

"...thanks"

They continue eating. The sun is shining onto the table, with no glare on either one's faces. The forest behind the small back garden yard can be seen with the leaves on the trees lightly ruffling each other.

"you smell so nice"

"Thanks," the first slightly blushes with a grin, "It was a great shower. Clear sun with a nice breeze. Absolutely amazing."

"ah i should go soon"

"You bet."

"anything happen this morning"

"Not really. I copped a piece of paper though for you to write with. You wanted to write something right?"

"ah i wanted to try today"

"Oh maybe I should've taken more..."

"no it's fine...who knows if i'll even write anything today"

"Okay, well if you do start, and need more, I'll gladly get you some."

"thanks...well...not that i want to see them really...but i can just get some myself when i go take a shower..."

"No don't worry about it. If you need more time, you need more time."

"...okay..."

"Please don't worry about it."

"just telling me to not worry about you won't make me not worry about you"

The first one is slightly taken aback. It was unexpected.

"...I'm sorry."

"its ok... it's just me. i already know youre fine doing everything we need to do"

"I'm not doing everything. You're doing a lot by just existing. Just being around right now is enough you need to do for me you know. I'm doing all of this, if you can consider it all of this, because I want to."

"...thanks. stop downplaying yourself though it smells"

"Okayy, just for youu,"

"hehe"

A pleasant silence arises back, as they both finish their breakfast, and sit with each other's silent company.

"Shower? You want me to come with?"

"i can take a shower myself you know..."

"Noo that's not what I meant... come on you know I love taking showers with you"

"mmmmif you really want"

A momentary silence passes. The first one thinks "Ah I need to stop being so selfish" and then says that out loud.

"Ah. It's fine. I should really be less selfish... I'm sorry."

The second one is going "no... ok, i think i want you to come actually"

The first one feels terrible now, and then just says, "...Okay"

They are completely silent as they walk from the house to the shower. The stream is still glistening as much as it was earlier in the morning. The breeze is still blowing/

"You know it's honestly amazing that you made this"

"mmm..."

Another thought passes "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh........ FUCK"

They both get undressed. A nice chair is brought by the first, and the second sits on it. The first one rinses the second one with water and makes sure every part of the body is rinsed. 

"It's shampoo day today right?"

"yea"

"Aighty."

"when was the last time we showered together"

"...quite a bit hasn't it?"

"yea..."

The first one lathers the shampoo, massaging it deep into the second one's hair and scalp. Body soap is then lathered onto the entire skin. 

"honestly         im glad you suggested coming with me"

Another thought, "Are you really..." passes in the first ones mind

"I'll always do this for you if you want."

"i know..."

Thoughts are rushing in the first one's mind. "Please. Please just say you don't want to feel like you are completely dependant on me. Please just say that you want to feel like you can do things yourselves. I just want you to say it. I literally cannot say it. Just say it. Please. Just say it. This all gets resolved if you just say it. I want to do this, but I want you to feel like you are in control of yourself too. I want you to just say it. PLEASE JUST SAY IT. I JUST WANT YOU TO SAY IT. I WANT YOU TO FEEL IN CONTROL. I DON'T WANT TO BE SELFISH. PLEASE JUST SAY YOU WANT TO BE MORE IN CONTROL. YOU WANT TO BE MORE INDEPENDANT ON THINGS."

"...you're stressed"

"Fuck."

"you know you really didn't need to do this for me"

"I wanted to."

"please just be honest"

"But I am. Why do you think I'm not being honest? I've even said it before that I love taking showers and baths with you. Why do you think I'm lying?"

"..."

Another thought. "FUCK ME"

"i love you you know"

"I love you so much too...", the first one is on the verge of tears, "I love you so much."

"we have so much, i can't believe we are here"

ANOTHER THOUGHT. "ARE YOU BEING HONEST?"
...
The first one takes some deep breaths.

"do you feel like you can't tell me"

The anxiety spikes again.

"No.... just.... just give me a bit please."

"okay..."

More deep breaths.

"..."
"..."

"I'll bring it up once we're back home," the first one says, as the mind processes.

"okay, im so worried about you"

"I know..."

The mood is low, but gradually rises, as the first completely bathes the second.

"that was so wonderful"

"Thanks..." after a bit of a pause, "That's really good for me to hear right now actually."

"...mmm... that's good"

The first is lost in thought, the second is quite gleeful, but visibly low in energy. They both walk back to the house, talking about sweet nothings. They talk about how the air feels so nice, then about the wind, then the moon's pull of the wind, then the moon's existence, and then the moon's craters. The craters caused by asteroids. The moon never knew about the asteroids coming. The asteroids still hit them anyway though. It's such an odd occurrence of events happening multiple times; however, the moon still stands, still orbits, and still pulls the wind.

They walk back to the house, through the luscious front garden, and back inside. They hold both hands together and kiss for a fleeting minute, before the second one says,

"everything is so hard isn't it"

"It really is..."

"yea"

"..."

"do you still not want to bring it up"

"No I do. I wanted to bring it up before too."

"oh...not the right time still"

"I guess. I'm sorry..."

"it's ok," a light peck, "not like we are going anywhere from here for a long while...i want to sleep again"

"Tired?"

"i did sleep for so long..."

"Well if you're tired, you're tired you know. It's not like we have any obligations today or tomorrow."

"true..."

"Why am I so paranoid?"

"i don't know, i feel like i'm a failure still because i don't know... it's been so long and i still don't know..."

"..."

The doorbell rings. The second one jumps a bit, and then starts running off to bed, "good night". The first one looks at the direction with a slight sadness, and opens the door. The third is back.

"Wheat delivery service!"

"Ah that's such coincidental timing! If you came a bit earlier we wouldn't have been home!"

"Oh! You guys went out?"

"Just a shower. I'd consider it though yea! It was great!"

"Oh... okay. I see. Need anything else? I'm all free."

"Wellllll.... can you finish your part of the new house? There's only so little left you know. We've all done our parts already."

"Ohhhhhhhh.......... yea you're right..."

"NOT to be a nag but..."

"No sorry about that. I just completely forgot. Darn I thought I was free today."

The first one laughs a bit, "heheh, don't worry about it. Really though there's nothing else to do though I think. I'll definitely let you know if there's something though."

"Sounds good. Take care. Please don't overwork yourself."

"...sure. See ya!"

"Peace."

The door is closed.
...
The piece of paper is still by the side of the door.
Looks like the second one is not writing today.
Looks like the first one isn't going to be honest either.
Looks like the third one isn't going to apologize either. 
...
Another thought comes to the first one, "Time to make some pastries..."
