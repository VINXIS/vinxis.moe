Played a lot of games this month especially because I basically became lost on what I should be doing this month... oh well. Here's some quick thoughts I've had on games I played recently
# [Mouthwashing](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475490/Mouthwashing/)
Really short game...
Honestly kinda overpriced for the experience I got, and it's also pretty overrated........... but it was quite good.
<br>The gameplay was really nothing burger, but it didn't matter considering it's a very story based game. The parts that DO matter for a story based game were really well done. The characters were really well written, with every single character not being flat shitty static characters, and have various levels of dimensionality to them.
<br>The story honestly could've gotten a bit further into its exploration of its themes, but honestly it's still a decent level of depth into it. Honestly you just watch a longplay of it instead of playing it though it's the exact same experience. But it is worth supporting the devs for the game (after) it's pretty good. Dunno.
<br>No spoilers but kill all men frrr

Super late to the party but whatever mann;
<br>it's pretty good, but it's also like a goodâ„¢ type of game and not like a *good* game in my opinion. The metroidvania aspect of this game was actually really annoying, just traversing the shit after a while it's like ok man what the fuck am I doing.
<br>The bosses were epic af tho, and the lore is also pretty sick honestly. I actually got shivers when I reached a certain cutscene regarding voids... NO SPOILERS!!!
<br>But honestly if the game didn't lean so hard on it's metroidvania, and also if it didn't have random platforming moments (they suck ass honestly), this game would be really epic, but it's like... just good... in my opinion.

Honestly I hate gacha but I wanted to play this after seeing it on The Game Awards because I got a brain worm seeing it.
<br>My expectations were like a chill game with chill mechanics and u just run around looking at pretty stuff. And... like it does do that... but also the writing is ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS. I have never seen such bizarre dialogue writing ever. And a lot of the game progression and mechanics are locked off by the story, so you HAVE to engage with that bullshit in order to play more video game. :\\
<br>Also I'm not gonna lie the gacha moment with 23589342895349 menus is so fucking annoying, and also all the faces are like literally emotionless, EXCEPT for the random ass tiny cat that runs around with you. The platforming is bare minimum but it's what's expected I guess.
<br>Honestly probably never opening the game after playing it for 2 hours, BUT it did give me a game idea that I've noted down for myself, to potentially..... uhhh.... work on maybe.... idk large ass undertaking for 0

Ok like I didn't really have any expectations but it was weirdly way more than I was expecting for a random shitty looking porn game on the internet. There's like a VERY complex set of systems and paths you can go in for the entire game for some reason (though the game's UI isn't really good at explaining how anything works/gives you 0 info)
<br>Probably never playing it again though because I don't really give a shit about porn
<br>AND I ended up breaking my immersion completely when some really bizzarely fucked up shit happened because I was like "what if I just don't pay my rent this time" (you have to pay gradually increasing rent every month or whatever) and everyone including yourself just go back to normal as if nothing happened immediately after you get back from the shit that happened. The writing is also like bruh, but whatever.
<br>Kudos to the dev though for making this over the years just to learn how to code, it's really impressive from a technical standpoint.

Epic. The story sux and is nothingburger and just feels like it was tacked on but otherwise its epic video game. Metroidvania with crazy movement mechanics.
<br>Oh the bosses suck for the most part (especially one of the bosses in the endings that was absolutely fucking terrible) but that's like whatever. 
<br>The overwhelming majority of the game is not really combat and moreso platforming funnies and the platforming funnies are really good. Yummy game. Didn't play DLC and find everything though because it started randomly eating my left/A inputs and ruined it for me. But it seems to just be me that has this issue so idk.
<br>PLAY THE GAME!!!!

I wish it won the game awards it would've been so funny.
<br>Game is FINE. It's like as much as you expect from what was just a prototype idea of a gameplay loop relying on roguelike. I like it when the number gets epic and massive and e13 and shit tho Lol.
<br>Not a big card player usually but the idea of combining gambling with roguelikes into its fundamentals was pretty genius im not gonna lie
