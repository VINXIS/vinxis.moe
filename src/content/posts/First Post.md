Yo
<br>
So this is basically my first post since I've finally finished the fundamental setup of my website!!!11
<br>
I've been considering adding a sitemap, but the sidebar basically links to every page that isn't a blog/note/post, so I ultimately felt like it would be useless...
<br>
I've also been considering adding comments to every page that exists in the realm of blogs/notes/posts, maybe using GitHub Discussion comments through [Giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus), but I'm still not exactly sure if I should go with that or not, and the potential pitfalls of it. It's also probably more than 0 effort to implement for me, and has the potential for spam... so I need to figure out that stuff if I actually will do that.
<br>
Though honestly just having no comments on the site might be a good idea as well...
<br>
Anyway not sure how often I'm gonna make posts like this, I'd rather focus on making blog posts and fixing/adding more notes that are also more comprehensive and all. Notes are basically my personal wiki, and blogs are meant to be like genuine articles that I'm writing. Posts are just random shit I wanna throw out into the internet, and I have no idea how often I'm gonna end up using this. They are probably not gonna be this long either...
<br>
Ok bye I'm gonna probably start cleaning stuff like at [[BIOCH 200]], and I'm busy trying to get out of hell because IRL just keeps getting worse!!!! :D Job searching!!!!! The greatest grift to exist for humanity
