Spliceosomes are large [[Ribonucleoprotein]]s consisting of 5 smaller [[Ribonucleic Acid]]s that are used to bind to [[Introns]], and remove them from [[Molecular Gene]] to create [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid]]s.

Sometimes spliceosomes are needed as some [[Introns]] themselves may splice themselves out
