#Zaregoto 
A genius girl that [[Ii]] accomplices with for their stay at the [[Wet Crow's Feather Island]]. She has very blue hair and eyes, and wears a very large jet-black men's coat that touches the ground. In contrast she also loves her environment to consist of only a pure white colour.

She was the leader of the [[Hacker Team]] which supposedly influenced the technological advances of the [[Zaregoto]] world.
