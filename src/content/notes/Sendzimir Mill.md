A Sendzimir Mill adds rows of rollers of smaller radiuses as the rollers near the area f contact with the material.

This allows the benefits of high roll radius, which provides high maximum [[Rolling Draft]] and [[Rolling Power]] while reducing the true [[Contact Length]] of the material to be minimal.
