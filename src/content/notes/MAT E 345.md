[[Corrosion]] is the damage occurred to the metal by the environment

[[Rust]] is specific to corrosion on Iron only.
[[Patina]] is specific to corrosion on Copper
[[Tarnish]] is specific corrosion on Silver

Corrosion is an extension of electrochemistry as it is an electrochemical process. This energy can be harnessed using a [[Corrosion Cell]]
