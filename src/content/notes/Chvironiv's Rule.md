Chvironiv's Rule relates the time for a material to solidify to the volume and surface area of a mold in [[casting]], which is as follows
$$t=C_m\left(\frac{V}{A}\right)^2$$
Where $t$ is solidification time, $V$ is cast volume, $A$ is cast surface area, $C_m$ is the mold constant.

The mold constant is dependant on different properties of both, the metal being casted, and the material used for casting as well.
