Materials processing is the means of manipulating the characteristics of a material such as shaping, heating, reacting, polishing, e.t.c.

Deciding on which processes to use depends on the design requirements of the project.

The 4 main categories of processing are:
[[Primary Shaping]]
[[Secondary Processes]]
[[Joining]]
[[Surface Treatment]]

The 4 main principles of processing are:
- Heating (Raising temperature and adding energy to the material)
- Beating (Applying stress and/or pressure to the material)
- Sticking (Joining materials together)
- Polishing (Refining the material surface by cutting locally)
