Transfer Ribonucleic Acid (tRNA also previously known as sRNA/soluble RNA) is a [[Ribonucleic Acid]] (RNA) that works with another RNA called [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid]] (mRNA) to generate proteins from their transcriptions. Transcription of an mRNA usually occurs at a [[Ribosome]] site, where tRNAs take their respective amino acids to transfer to the [[Ribosome]] sites.

The tRNA structure usually contains 3 [[Hairpin Loop]]s, a small [[Variable Loop]], and an [[Acceptor Arm]] to carry amino acids.
