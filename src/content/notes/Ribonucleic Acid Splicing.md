The second primary part of [[Gene Expression]].

In this process [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid]]s are transformed into mature [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid]]s.

Parts of the RNA called [[Introns]] are sliced out from the sequences, and other parts called [[Exons]] are then fused together.

For [[Eukaryotic]] genes, splicing is required for [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid]]s to function at all. For [[Prokaryotic]] genes, it's not entirely necessary. In fact, for prokaryotes, splicing is almost always just for [[Non-Coding Ribonucleic Acid]]s and nothing else... usually.

During this process "trapping [[Exons]]" can also be exploited by slicing a combination of Intron-Exon-Intron to create new [[Molecular Gene]]s

The splicing occurs by [[Spliceosome]]s binding to the [[Introns]], and fold the Intron to close the Intron on itself in a loop, while simultaneously fusing the 2 [[Exons]] together.

[[Introns]] in this process used to be thought of as useless waste, but use cases were found afterwards. Which ones idk
