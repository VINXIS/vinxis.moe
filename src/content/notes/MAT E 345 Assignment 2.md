Second assignment for [[MAT E 345]]

1.
Assuming chlorine concentration in this case is non-trivial:
	$Cu = Cu^{2+} + 2e^- \ E^{\circ}= -0.342V$
	$Cl_{2} + 2e^- = 2Cl^- \ E^{\circ}= 1.358V$
	$E_{cell}^{\circ} = 1.358V - (-0.342V) = 1.700V$

2.
(a)
![[MAT E 345 Assignment 1 Q2a.png]] 
Lead will not corrode in deaerated water at pH=7. It resides within the area where Lead is the most stable state.

(b)
![[MAT E 345 Assignment 1 Q2b.png]]
Lead will not corrode in aerated water at pH=7 either. A $PbO_2$ layer will instead form on the surface of the lead, which will block all the lead from the rest of the water within it.

Aluminum
$i_{\text{corr}} = 10\frac{\mu\text{A}}{\text{cm}^2} = 0.1\frac{\text{A}}{\text{m}^2}$
$M= 26.98\frac{\text{g}}{\text{mol}}$
$d=2.71\frac{\text{g}}{\text{cm}^3}$
$n=3$
$t_h=0.2mm$ (both sides are exposed, each side can corrode half, so 0.4mm/2)
$\text{corr rate [mm/y]} = 0.327\frac{i_{\text{corr}}M}{nd} = 0.332 \frac{\text{mm}}{\text{y}}$
(a) 
$t=\frac{t_h}{\text{corr rate}} = 0.603 \text{y} = 7.236 \text{m} = 220.112 \text{d} = 5282.692 \text{h} = 316961.520 \text{min}$(b)
$\text{corr rate [ipy]} = \frac{\text{corr rate [mm/y]}}{25.4} = 0.0131 \text{ipy}$
(c)
$\text{corr rate [gm}^2\text{d}^{-1}\text{]} = \text{corr rate [mm/y]}\cdot 2.74 d = 2.464 \text{gm}^2\text{d}^{-1}$
