Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) also known as transcripts, carry the coding sequences to synthesize their specific [[Protein]]. Transcription usually occurs in a [[Ribosome]] site. They are also usually the largest RNAs found in cell sites, ranging from around 300 - 12000 [[Nucleotide]]s.

The distribution of the types of mRNA in a cell characterises a cell's [[Transcriptome]]
