Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) are [[Somatic Cell]]s or differentiated cells that have transformed into [[Stem Cell]]s. This was initially done by adding 4 specific genes to normal cells:
- Myc
- Oct3/4
- Sox2
- Klf4

Oct3/4 and the "Sox gene family" are considered as the crucial genes for [[Ribonucleic Acid Transcription]] regulation. Other ones such as Myc and Klf4 aren't exactly necessary, but increase the efficiency to a feasible rate.
