[[Ribonucleic Acid]] Sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a core method of [[Transcriptomics]] to obtain the [[Transcriptome]] from a sample as data to use for many use cases such as looking at [[Alternative Splicing]], changes in [[Gene Expression]], and others.

There are various forms of RNA-Seq:
- [[Single Cell Sequencing]]
- [[Bulk Sequencing]]
- [[Sanger Sequencing]]
- [[3' mRNA-seq]]
