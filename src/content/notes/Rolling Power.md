Rolling Power is the power that is required to roll a material. Since the rolling power is focused on the rotation of the rollers, the result is a product of the angular velocity and the [[Rolling Torque]]. This result is as follows:
$$P=2\pi NFL = 4\pi NT$$

Where $N$ is the rotational speed of the roller.
