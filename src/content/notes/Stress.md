Internal resistances that a material's body experiences, which can as a result create [[Strain]]

Considered as pressure $\sigma$, so:
$$\sigma=\frac{F}{A}$$

2 types of stress that matter are [[Engineering Stress]] and [[True Stress]], using the initial and instantaneous cross-sectional areas 

[[Shear Stress]] ($\tau$) however is parallel to the surface it's acting on, and functions entirely differently.
