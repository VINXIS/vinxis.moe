Hopefully Corsace Open this iteration has more custom songs created this year than previous years and a new website and all

# Mappools
Each round needs a mappool finished. Mappools consist of 11 beatmaps for Qualifiers, and 20 beatmaps for the other rounds.

The plan is also to get a good handful of custom songs as well from some people. This will be one of the 2 below:
- All tiebreakers (6 songs)
- All of GF (20 songs)
It would also be great to get videos for them as well.

The cost however needs to be mitigated from somewhere, so the plan is to get money from sponsors
