Bonds between the nitrogen from an [[Amino]] to an oxygen from a [[Carboxylate]].

These are typically seen in [[Amino Acid]]s and [[Protein]]s where [[Amino Acid]]s are joined together by their ionized [[Carboxylate]] and [[Amino]] groups together.

In typical peptide bonds, the $\alpha$-Carbon is the carbon connected to the nitrogen on the other side of the peptide bond (the one not connected to a [[Carbonyl]])

If there is a biological function to this peptide, then it is called a [[Protein]]
