# Intro to [[Cell Biology]]
There are 4 objects to [[Cell Biology]].
1. To learn what a [[Cell]] is and what it's made of
2. To understand the [[cellular environment]] that exists
3. To understand how [[Cell]]s CAN work/function
4. To understand how knowledge is generated for these fields

Hans and Zacharias invented the first [[compound microscope]] in the 16th century

Hooke worked with people who used microscopes up to 30x magnification in the 17th century

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek built his microscopes upto 300x magnification

Theodor Schwann created the first 2 points of [[Cell Theory]] in 1839

Rudolph Virchow added the third part of [[Cell Theory]] in 1855

Fredrich Wöhler showed compounds living organisms make can be made in a lab with urea as an example in 1828, which contradicted vitalism.

Eduard Buchner showed sugar can be fermented without yeast using [[Enzyme]]s such as zymase in 1897

Gregor Mendel laid the foundation on the understanding of how hereditary factors pass from parents to offspring using pea plants in 1866. Called [[Genes]]

Walther Flemming discovered [[Chromosome]]s in 1880. Called the process in which they appeared [[Mitosis]]

Wilhelm Roux and August Weisman suggested [[Chromosome]]s are genetics in 1883

Walter Sutton and Theodor Boveri formulated the [[Chromosome Theory]]

Thomas Morgan, Calvin Bridges, and Alfred Sturtevant connected specific traits to [[Chromosome]]s in 1920
	Identical crosses between white and red eyed flies gave completely different results depending on the sex of the fly

Experiments with bacteria and viruses began implicating [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] with genetic material

George Beadle and Edward Tatum created the one gene - one enzyme concept

James Watson and Francis Crick proposed the double helix structure for [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] in 1953.

- *in vitro* - using purified chemicals, biomolecules, or cellular components
- *in vivo* - using live cells/organisms
- *in silico* - using computational approaches or computer models

[[Model Organisms]] are used for most experiments
- E. coli
- S. cerevisiae
- Drosophilia
- C. elegans
- Mus musculus
- Arabidopsis

[[Cell Biology]] is important for dealing with diseases as they all are caused by cellular dysfunction

# [[Imaging]] and [[Cell Biology]]

- Unaided eye range is ~0.5 mm - 
- Light eye microscope range is ~0.5 nm - 50 mm
- Electron Microscope range is 1 angstrom - 100 um

The light microscope allowed identification of [[Organelles]] within [[Cell]]s

Light wavelength range is 400 - 700 nm.

Compound microscopes increased both magnification and resolution and helped discover the nucleus.

Mitochondri can be seen using light microscopy

[[Microtome]]s allow preparation of many very thin slices of a sample.

Scientists started staining  [[Cell]]s in the 19th century improving visual contrast between structures using the chemical properties of the substance to react with the dyes.

| Stains      | Charge          | Binds to         | Colour          |
| ----------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Hematoxylin | Positive/Basic  | Negative Charges | Blue            |
| Eosin       | Negative/Acidic | Positive Charges | Orange/Pink/Red | 

Limit of resolution is the limit of how far 2 objects can distinctively be told apart visually

Resolving power = Resolution

$R = \frac{0.612\lambda}{NA}$
$NA=n\cdot\sin\alpha$
$R=\frac{0.612\lambda}{n\sin\alpha}$

Phase Contrast and Differential Interference Contast Microscopy both take advantages of changes in light

Fluorescence Microscopy uses dyes to show locations of stuff in the cell

Confocal Scanning Microscopy uses a laser to illuminate a single plane of a specimen that has been dyed.

There are 3 ways fluorescence microscopy can find out what a protein encoded by a specific gene does:
- Stain the protein with a dye
- Target the protein with an antibody
- Express a fusion protein by joining a fluorescent protein to the protein of interest

- Blue (nucleus – DAPI staining of DNA)
- Red (granules)
- Green (filaments of the cytoskeleton)

Phalloidin stains the actin protein

Indirect assay uses antibodies with fluorescence onto antibodies
Direct assay uses antibodies with fluorescence onto proteins

1. Plate cells on coverslip 
2. Fix 
3. Permeabilize 
4. Block 
5. Incubate with primary antibody (that recognizes the target antigen)
6. Wash
7. If using (indirect assay), incubate with secondary antibody (that recognizes epitopes on primary antibody)
8. Wash
9. Visualize

The issue with this though is that it is disruptive and static, also limited by antibodies

Widefield microscopy has less out of focus light to deal with compared top Confocal microscopy, which has improved z-resolution

Resolution can be improved using stochastic activation of fluorophores

Atomic force microscopy

Transmission electron microscopy is when electrons are transmitted through the specimen, while in Scanning electron microscopy electrons reflect from the surface

# Cellular Organization
The carbon atom (C) is the most important atom in biological molecules

![[Common Carbon Bond Energies.png]]

Water is important because:
- It's a good solvent
- It's cohesive
- It's temperature-stabilizing
- It provides hydrolysis and condensation
	- Hydrolysis is when water is a reactant
	- Condensation is when water is a product

The cellular hierarchy:
- Monomers
- Polymers
- Macromolecule mixtures
- Organelles and other structures
- Cells

Small organic molecules polymerize to form biological macromolecules

Supramolecular structures 

Advantages of sub-assembly:
- Chemical simplicity
- Assembly Efficiency
- Quality control

Enzymes function as catalysts, increasing the rates of chemical reactions 
Structural proteins - physical support and shape 
Motility proteins - contraction and movement 
Regulatory proteins - control and coordinate cell function 
Transport proteins - move substances in and out of cells
Hormonal proteins - communication between cells 
Receptor proteins - enable cells to respond to stimuli from the environment 
Defensive proteins - protect against cell damage and pathogens
Storage proteins - reservoirs of amino acids

Many proteins possess common structure or sequence motifs

Any abilities that a protein has can be referred to as an ‘activity’

A polypeptide must fold into a functional three-dimensional structure to become a protein

The folding of a protein is driven by a complicated ensemble of interactions

Electrophoresis are a group of methods using an electric field to separate molecules

Plasmids are circular [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] molecules that automatically replicate in bacteria
