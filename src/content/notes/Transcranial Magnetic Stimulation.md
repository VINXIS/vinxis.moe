Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a tool that uses [[Electromagnetic Induction]] to induce an electric current across the scalp and skull. This produces a magnetic field that varies/changes, creating an electric current into the brain that activates nearby nerve cells. The strength is similar to an MRI's strength or around 2-3 Teslas, and reaches around 5 cm of depth into the brain. The currents created into the brain can either cause [[Depolarization]] or [[Hyperpolarization]] to the neurons (increase/decrease excitation) in the area.

There are 2 primary types of TMS:
1. Single/Paired Pulse TMS: Causes [[Depolarization]] in the site. 
	1. If used in the [[Primary Motor Cortex]] area of the brain, it causes muscle activity shown as [[Motor Evoked Potential]].
	2. At the [[Occipital Cortex]], it can cause the patient to experience [[Phosphene]]s.
	3. At other areas, various behaviour alterations/changes in brain activity could be seen, but not consciously observable by the patient.
2. Repetitive TMS (rTMS): Causes effects that are more longer-lasting and persistent after the stimulation period. Effects can change depending on the frequency used. Its effects are believed to be dictated by [[Long-term Potentiation]]/Depression. This also seems to cause [[Motor Evoked Potential]] changes that can be recorded
	1. <1Hz is known to inhibit neurons firing in the cerebral cortex.
	2. >1Hz is known to provoke neurons firing in the cerebral cortex. 

## Diagnostics<sup>[1]</sup>
### Excitation
Typical diagnostic use of TMS in terms of cortical excitation is via recording the [[Motor Evoked Potential]] (MEP). [[Electromyography]] signals are collected from MEPs that are induced by TMS, and can as a result be shown any irregularities in MEP readings.

[[Resting Motor Threshold]] (RMT) can also be used as a variable to observe any irregularities in cortical excitation/neuron firing in the cerebral cortex.

### Depression
Typical diagnostic use of TMS in terms of cortical depression is via recording the [[Cortical Silent Period]] (CSP). This is typically shown as a lack of EMG activity after TMS is applied.
