**Primary bonds**

3 main types of chemical bonds:
## [[Ionic Bond]]
One or more electrons are **transferred from** one atom to another
When one atom has a **stronger capability** to grab an electron than the other

## [[Covalent Bond]]
One or more electrons are **shared between** one atom to another
When both atoms have **similar capabilities** to grab an electron

## Metallic bond
Multiple atoms of the same metal grouped as positively charged nuclei in a sea of valence electrons.

these bonds are much stronger than [[Van der Waals]], their [[Atomic Interaction]] is much stronger
