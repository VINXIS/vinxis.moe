![[Fogg Model Image.png]]

The Fogg Model is a [[Behavioural Change Theory]] which states 4 things:
- Behaviour: The action that is wanted
- Motivation: The [[Behaviour Drivers]]
- Ability: The level of skill you have
- Prompt: A reminder
Behaviour is dictated by Motivation, Ability, and Prompt. 

Motivations and abilities are proportional to each other.
The more motivation needed the more ability needed.

Behaviours easier to do are able to handle more volatile motivations.
