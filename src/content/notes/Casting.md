Casting is a [[Primary Shaping]] process that requires a material to be melted and molded for a desired shape, and allows for great versatility in the resulting products.

Castings have drawbacks, their corrosion resistance and strength are far lower than their original state due to phases segregating and courser/larger grains.

Higher and lower strength can be achieved using different cooling rates for resulting casts. 

It is possible when cooling that the solute of the alloy diffuses ahead of the solid-liquid interface in the temperature gradient, which causes [[Supercooling]]. When this occurs in the alloy, the typical spherical shape that is formed from [[Nucleation]] becomes unstable, and begins to grow in specific directions instead, forming [[Dendrites]]. If cooling is faster, dendrite growth can be mitigated by excess [[nucleation]] taking space.
- Faster cooling rates -> Higher [[nucleation]] rate -> Fewer [[dendrites]]
- Slower cooling rates -> Lower [[nucleation]] rate -> Larger [[dendrites]]

For the general casting process, a [[casting pattern]] is used to create the main design of the material. It is placed in the molding material, and then removed to create the opening shape to insert the melt, creating a [[mold cavity]]. To create features such as holes into the final product, [[casting core]]s have to be added into the [[mold cavity]].

Solidification of an alloy from casting exhibits behaviour described by [[Scheil Theory]]. Casting also causes the resulting cast to shrink in the end. [[Risers]] are necessary for casting to mitigate the shrinkage that occurs in liquid-state and solidification. Porosity can occur from shrinkage, so it should be avoided.

Melt is added into the [[mold cavity]] using a [[Gating System]]. 

Multiple types of casting exist:
- [[Sand Casting]]
- [[Investment Casting]]
- [[Die Casting]]
- [[Slush Casting]]
- [[Injection Molding]]
