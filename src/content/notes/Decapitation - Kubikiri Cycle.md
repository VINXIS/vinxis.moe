#Zaregoto 
The first book in the [[Zaregoto]] series written by [[Nisio Isin]]. 

# Setting
The story so far takes place in [[Wet Crow's Feather Island]] around September. This island is owned by a member disowned from a place called the [[Akagami Foundation]] named [[Iria Akagami]].

# Characters
- [[Ii]]
	The protagonist of the story who has came here as a tagalong for [[Kunagisa Tomo]]. Relatively speaking, he's considered very very below average compared to lot residing on this island where many geniuses come to.
- [[Kunagisa Tomo]]
	The engineer that [[Ii]] is partnered with. She uses a fictional Unix OS called [[Geocide]] made by her friend from a place called the [[Hacker Team]], and 3 computers which she likes to state as 1 workstation and 2 PCs.
- [[Shinya]]
	A tagalong parallel to [[Ii]] for another genius named [[Kanami Ibuki]]. One of the very few male characters in the story, also parallel to [[Ii]].
- [[Kanami Ibuki]]
	An artistic genius who had gone blind and is wheelchair-bound. She is known even by people who don't know much of the artistic field.
- [[Iria Akagami]]
	A girl who was disowned by the [[Akagami Foundation]] that owns the [[Wet Crow's Feather Island]] and invites groups of geniuses over once in a while to supposedly ease her own boredom.
- [[Rei Handa]]
	Head maid of the [[Wet Crow's Feather Island]]. Looks much older than the sister maids.
- [[Akari Chiga]]
	Oldest sister of the maids on the [[Wet Crow's Feather Island]]. [[Ii]] states she looked much younger and this could mean that the sisters in general are very young in age, possibly even underaged.
- [[Hikari Chiga]]
	The middle sister of the maids on the [[Wet Crow's Feather Island]]. She seems to be much more energetic and lively in general.
- [[Akane Sonoyama]]
	One of [[Seven Fools]] geniuses.
- [[Professor Hewlett]]
	Considered the smartest person ever, at least by [[Akane Sonoyama]] and [[Ii]] who allegedly mastered every field ever within single digit age.
- [[Maki Himena]]
	A fortune-telling genius who is relatively cheerful but also has low blood pressure.
- [[Aikawa]]
	A jack-of-all-trades genius who [[Iria Akagami]] seems to love a lot.

## Annotations
### [[2022 01-02]]
- Book starts off with a [[Nietzsche]] quote when listing the cast of characters right underneath [[Ii]]. `"Having one too many talents is even more dangerous than having one too few."` (p. 5) Maybe implying at the surface that the protagonist may be very generalized in his skills and possibly dangerous as a result.
- `Don't be so edgy.\n Relax, okay?` (p. 13) is the start of the first chapter and considered its very own subsection with its text bolded as it dumps the reader into the morning of the third day of [[Ii]]'s stay. This may imply the general theme of this chapter as him trying to chill and calm down while checking out the rest of the people in the island as his inferiority complexes rise up from time to time.
- `The interior was vast. Pure white carpet and pure white wallpaper complemented pure white furniture ... Kunagisa was crazy about the colour white` (p. 15) she either really loves emptiness or really loves the light. The latter later emphasized by `I like for the sun to be way high up in the sky when I wake up` (p. 16)
- `"I'm just Tomo Kunagisa's sidekick. No need for an accoutrement to have a name, am I right?"` (p. 22) doing many things in this line, adding the inferiority complex narrative that [[Ii]] has, as well as masking it under a sense of humbleness which [[Shinya]] liked pointing out stating `"That's awfully modest of you"` (p. 22). The conversation also becomes more focused towards the inferiority complex later as well.
- `"How could I not have a complex Shinya"` (p. 29) After reminiscing about the [[Hacker Team]] and how incredible it was [[Ii]] remembered the conversation he had earlier with [[Shinya]] about his inferiority complex.

### [[2022 01-03]]
- Right at the end of the passage read this night it sticks another pole into the area of [[Ii]]'s inferiority complex with [[Maki Himena]] stating `Well, whatever. You don't matter anyway. ... You're the Japanese representative of things that don't matter.` (p. 50)
- [[Ii]] is also blasted by [[Maki Himena]] about how naïve he seemingly is by stating: `You just take everything at face value, don't you? ... it looks like you intentionally adjust all your beliefs when you're talking to other people. That's surely a comfortable way to live, but I wouldn't call it a wise one.` (p. 50)

### [[2022 01-04]]
- More insight towards the thought of [[Ii]] being very naïve as he meets with [[Kanami Ibuki]], where [[Ii]] believes that the field of art is meant to replicate the features of reality while [[Kanami Ibuki]] believes that the artistic field is meant to provide importance and context on the pareidolia the artist experiences in their relationship with reality. `But it was so realistic` (p. 61) he stated, to which she replied `That's not a compliment either, you know.` (p. 61) which extended into a discussion about the history and purpose of art and photography 

### [[2022 01-06]]
- A jack-of-all-trades genius is implied to be coming at the end of [[Ii]] and [[Kunagisa Tomo]]'s stay, who seems to be [[Iria Akagami]]'s so-called love of her life named [[Aikawa]]. This was the start of the chaos that occurs in the dinner table as [[Iria Akagami]] unknowingly attacks [[Kanami Ibuki]]'s ego stating `I imagine something as simple as painting a picture shouldn't be a challenge.` (p. 73) in response to Shinya's question.
- More character relationships are established for the reader especially with [[Ii]] vs [[Maki Himena]], and [[Akane Sonoyama]] vs [[Kanami Ibuki]]. While the latter was already well known by the related characters themselves as they `looked fairly indifferent` (p. 76) and `entirely uninterested` (p. 76). In fact, from both of the constant back and forth fights that occur, [[Kunagisa Tomo]] was the only one that stated to stop, showing more of her wants to always be in a fun and joyful time and her more child-like nature (though the book is not subtle about it).
	- [[Maki Himena]] truly despises [[Ii]] though, probably more than [[Akane Sonoyama]] and [[Kanami Ibuki]] do with each other, while `she [seems] to be getting along with everyone besides me rather well` (p. 88).
- We find out that [[Kunagisa Tomo]] actually was on the island for a reason, and it is related to a murder, `interested in an incident that took place here in the past` (p. 91) possibly foreshadowing what is to come, and what the connections may end up as from this murder and the previous, especially with how this section of the book ends with `Damn, I want to return to my tranquil, quotidian life across the sea ... But the following morning I would realize something. The previous three days have been plenty tranquil and quotidan.` (p. 99)

### [[2022 01-07]]
- [[Kanami Ibuki]] fucking Dies .
- Getting more insight into the previous murder than [[Kunagisa Tomo]] was so interested about `In any case, another death ... And another decapitation at that` (p. 113) which was stated by [[Iria Akagami]]. Hints that both this current murder, and the previous murder may be connected (though uncertain) as they share similarities as to how both victims were murdered.
- A deeper look into how these characters think of the police. [[Iria Akagami]] may be right with how the police may have just taken [[Akane Sonoyama]] as is, but she seemed very adamant in assuring that the police don't come.
- `Something about the painting was off, in a maddeningly subtle way` (p. 132) an interesting point by [[Ii]] and how it may point out that the painting was possibly not finished by [[Kanami Ibuki]] herself.
