Sintering is a form of [[Powder Compacting]] where heat and pressure are both applied to a powdered material, but not to the point of melting, otherwise it would be [[Casting]].

Sintering with heating can cause bonds to grow and connect stronger. Particle size doesn't affect the strength of the product, but the density of particles does. Sintering also decreases over time, and time has very little effect on the bond formation and shrinkage of sintering compared to something like pressure.
