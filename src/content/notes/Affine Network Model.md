The affine-deformation model builds off of the [[Freely Jointed Chain]] model, where it also assumes that the deformation of a given [[Polymer]] chain is the same as the deformation of the bulk polymer. 

The assumption is also that the scaling is [[isotropic]] so this gives us a scaling factor that is equivalent in all directions.

The general equation that results from this is the following [[Helmholtz Free Energy]] equation:
$$ \Delta F = \frac{nKT}{2}(\lambda_x^2+\lambda_y^2+\lambda_z^2-3)$$
n is number of polymer chains and lambda is the scaling factor, for [[Isotropy]]:
$$\lambda_x^2+\lambda_y^2+\lambda_z^2=\lambda^2$$$$\Rightarrow \Delta F = \frac{nKT}{2}(\lambda^2-3)$$
