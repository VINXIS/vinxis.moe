[[Monomer]]s that consist of the [[Amino]] [[Functional Group]] and [[Carboxylic Acid]] [[Functional Group]]

Joining them together forms [[Amide]]s that are called [[Peptide]] bonds, and ultimately form [[Protein]]

The 3 main groups based on their R group are:
- Hydrophobic (nonpolar/no pKa val)
- Polar (pKa val but unchaged at pH 7)
- Charged (most polar [[Functional Group]]s and charged at pH 7)

There are 20 core amino acids:
| Name          | Type        | pKa  | Charge at 0 pH | Charge at 7 pH | Charge at 14 pH | Functional Group(s)    |
