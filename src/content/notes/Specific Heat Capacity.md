Specific Heat Capacity $C_v$ describes the amount of energy needed to raise a given amount of mass by $1\degree C$.

At a constant volume, the heat capacity can be described with the following partial relationship
$$C_v=\left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial T}\right)_V$$

At very low T relative to the [[Einstein Temperature]] of a material, the Specific Heat Capacity of the material is 0
At very high T relative to the [[Einstein Temperature]] of a material, the Specific Heat Capacity of the material is equivalent to the upper limit constant of a material $3Nk_B$.
