Walking on [[Neon White Water]] makes u faster than normal ground.

Normal ground gives u a speed of 18.75, whil ewater gives u a speed of 33.75

a 15 speed increase

Turning on water will reduce the speed, similar to turning in normal [[Boosts#Turning]]

## Floating
Honestly idk what the fuck is going on but basically if ur slightly above the water ull accelerate more and get an even higher speed (I think u can even get like 50 speed this way)
### Methods
- Hold jump on inclined/tilted water (for example, Glass Port, Fasttrack)
- Touching an edge of something like stairs and stuff to put urself slightly up
- Jumping in very low ceiling (for example, the beginning of Movement)
- Timing a [[Neon White Card]] boost, or a jump, onto a water platform in a way where u are slightly above the water
