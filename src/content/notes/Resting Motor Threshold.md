The minimal stimulation intensity usually required to produce a reliable twitch/[[Motor Evoked Potential]] (MEP) in a muscle. This is typically defined as threshold required to make MEP peaks surpass 50 $\mu V$ 50% of the time they are recorded, and are important to note for avoiding seizures when calibrating tools such as [[Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation]] to stimulate neurons/cortical firing
