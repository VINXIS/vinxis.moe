The foundation of [[Biochemistry]]

There are 4 main classes of biomolecules
[[Protein]]
[[Carbohydrate]]
[[Nucleic Acid]]
[[Lipid]]

[[Amino Acid]]s, [[Carbohydrate]]s, [[Nucleotide]]s, and [[Lipid]]s are [[Monomer]]s

[[Protein]]s, [[Polysaccharide]]s, and [[Nucleic Acid]]s are [[Biopolymer]]s

[[Lipid]]s do not form [[Polymer]]s

Most of these are formed primarily from [[PHONCS]]

[[Biopolymer]]s are [[Polymer]]s formed from [[Amino Acid]]s, [[Nucleotide]]s, or [[Carbohydrate]]s.

[[Monomer]]s are joined using specific types of [[Covalent Bond]]s; however, [[Electrostatic Force]]s are more common than them.

[[Covalent Bond]] > [[Ionic Bond]] (electrostatic) > [[Hydrogen Bond]] (electrostatic) > [[Van der Waals]] (electrostatic) > [[Hydrophobic Effect]]

[[Hydrophobic Effect]] is NOT a bond. **HYDROPHOBIC BONDS DO NOT EXIST**
