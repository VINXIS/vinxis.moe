Ribosomes are [[Macromolecular Machine]]s that lock on to [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid]]s (mRNAs) and read the [[Codon]]s using sites to allow [[Transfer Ribonucleic Acid]]s on to synthesize into proteins.

Ribosomes consist of a large and small subunit that assemble together to lock the mRNA between them. This then converts sections of the mRNA decoded (until a stop codon) to create [[Amino Acid]]s/[[Polypeptide]]s/[[Protein]]s.

[[Ribosomal Ribonucleic Acid]]s (rRNA) create Ribosomes using the help of other pre-made proteins/enzymes. Ribosomes usually consist of multiple rRNAs, but can just be one each.
