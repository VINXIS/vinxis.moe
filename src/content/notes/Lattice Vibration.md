Lattice Vibration is the vibration that occurs due to the general "springiness" of atomic bonds in solids.

The freuqncy of a vibration can typically be given by the following relationship using the [[Lennard-Jones Potential]]:
$$\nu_0=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}=\frac{3}{\pi}\sqrt{\frac{2\epsilon_b}{mr_e^2}}$$
$k$ is the spring constant
$\epsilon_b$ is the [[Bond Energy]]
$r_e$ is the equilibrium bond distance
$m$ is the atomic mass

The [[Einstein Frequency]] is the vibration frequency of an atom inside a given crystal structure, where the spring constant is multiplied by the amount of nearest neighbours.

Ex: In an FCC crystal structure, there are 12 nearest neighbours, equivalent to 6 springs:
$$\nu_E=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{6k}{m}}=\frac{6}{\pi}\sqrt{\frac{3\epsilon_b}{mr_e^2}}=\nu_0\sqrt{6}$$
Almost all material properties are affected by lattice vibration.
