Deformation ultimately alters the shape of the material being used. These methods however can affect the microstructures of a material, altering mechanical properties as well.

Hot deformation can cause improved toughness, ductility, and [[anisotropy]] of a material.
Cold deformation can cause improved [[yield strength]], UTS, and [[isotropy]] of a material.
