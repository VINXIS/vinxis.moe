RNA translation is the process in which the [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid]] after [[Ribonucleic Acid Splicing]] occurs is then binded to a [[Ribosome]] to create space for [[Transfer Ribonucleic Acid]]s to attach with their specific [[Amino Acid]]s, to then generate a protein. 

The [[Codon]] that is provided by the [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid]] is the one referred to that translates to an [[Amino Acid]], not the anti-[[Codon]] in the [[Transfer Ribonucleic Acid]].
