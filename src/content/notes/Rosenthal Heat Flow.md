Rosenthal's Heat Flow equations are a set of 2-D and 3-D analysis of heat flow in a weld pool. It requires the assumptions:
- The heat source is a point source
- There is no flow of fluids
- No atmospheric heat loss

If the material being welded is far thicker than the welding zone, then 2-D analysis can be used; otherwise, the thickness of the welding zone will matter as well, and 3-D analysis is required.
