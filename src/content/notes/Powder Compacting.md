Powder Compacting is to compress powdered material at high pressures within a die to result in a single solid material. This may or may not require heating, but if it does require heating, this is usually related to [[Sintering]]

Powder compacting is usually done to create cylindrical objects. The ratio of the length and diameter of the resulting cylinder effects the resulting pressure required to form the product.

For non-cylindrical products, the ratio can be defined as:
$$\frac{L}{D} = \frac{V}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{A^2}}$$
A compaction curve factor is necessary to determine the resulting pressure, which is determined by
$$K=\frac{0.25}{3}(\frac{L}{D} - 1)$$
for $L/D > 1$.

Pressure is a result of the compaction curve factor, and a pressure constant factor, the relationships are as follows:
$$P=A\rho^b$$$$P=P_1(1+K)$$

Where $\rho$ is the part density of the material

The compression ratio factor $k_r$ can also be found as follows:
$$k_r=\frac{\rho}{\rho_a}$$
Where $\rho_a$ is the apparent density of a material.
