The absolute energy held by a bond at their lowest point in the [[Atomic Interaction]] relationship.

Using bond energy, the [[Sublimation]] and [[Vaporization]] energies can be calculated.

To calculate the bond energy using the heat of [[Sublimation]] or [[Vaporization]], the resulting units end up as eV/atom pair instead of J/atom. since the 1/2 multiplies it by 2 in the relationship
$$\epsilon_b = \frac{\Delta H}{\frac{1}{2}zN_a}$$
