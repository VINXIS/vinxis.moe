Corsace is a brand I created which currently only consists of [[osu!]] related projects. The main goal is to expand it and hopefully emerge it into the mainstream.

There is also a github repository: https://github.com/Corsace/Corsace

# The Projects
[[Corsace Open]] is currently the main event. A major, very large 4v4 tournament utilizing the draft format.

[[Corsace Closed]] is meant to be a side fundraising event for Corsace Open and is also functionally the opposite, being a very small invitational 1v1 tournament. 

[[Mapper's Choice Awards]] is the yearly awards for ranked mappers to vote on their favourite maps and mappers of the year.

# The Future
Hopefully we can get a store going that sells something. Not exactly sure what the plan is to sell, but we did start with the shirts.

A main website also needs to be started as a central hub for Corsace stuff, as well as projects not necessarily linked to anything.

Some planned features in my head

- [ ] [[Corsace Bot]]
	- [ ] #task maquiabot transfer
- [ ] [[Singletap Stock]] 
	- [ ] allow users to have their own stock
	- [ ] allow users to invest in other players
	- [ ] player stocks go up and down depending on their skill level
	- [ ] they all start with the initial pp they sign up with
- [ ] [[Corsace Tracker]]
	- [ ] similar to FunOrange's [[CircleTracker]]
	- [ ] showcasing play info
	- [ ] types of beatmaps played
	- [ ] attempt to see similarities and differences
- [ ] news
- [ ] possibly corporatize
	- [ ] base salary for staff
	- [ ] base salary for head staff
	- [ ] go on from there
