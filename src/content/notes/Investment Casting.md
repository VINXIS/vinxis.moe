Investment [[casting]] is a form of [[casting]] that is also as old as [[Sand Casting]], using wax molds to create materials. 

This [[casting]] method provides a far more excellent finish on surfaces, and high precision/accuracy for given dimensions/sizes. It is however relatively expensive, and cannot create holes of around 1/16 in.
