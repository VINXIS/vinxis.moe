Modulus describe the relationship between elastic [[Stress]] and [[Strain]] for a given material and for a given type of force.

[[Young's Modulus]] describes the relationship between elastic [[Stress]] and [[Strain]].

[[Shear Modulus]] describes the relationship between elastic [[Shear Stress]] and [[Shear Strain]].

[[Bulk Modulus]] describes the relationship between elastic compression.

[[Hooke's Law]] describes the relationship between modulus to [[Stress]] and [[Strain]] where:
$$\sigma=E\epsilon$$
