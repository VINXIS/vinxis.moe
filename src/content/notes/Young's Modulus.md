The slope of [[Elasticity]] when [[elastic deformation]] occurs which is stress / strain:
$$Y = \frac{\sigma_{e}}{\epsilon}$$
If carbon content in steels does not change the primary phase, then the Young's Modulus is **not affected**.


Using the [[Nearest-Neighbour Approximation]], the Young's Modulus can be calculated using $\sigma$
$$\sigma = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{\text{atoms}0.25k\Delta r}{a^2} = Y\epsilon$$
