Cell passaging (aka Subculturing or Splitting) is a lab technique to grow more cells from a given culture obtained. Cells of some amount (not all) from a previous medium are transferred to a new medium in order to continue their proliferation.

1. Cells should be examined via microscope and visually for contamination
2. Previous media is drained/vacuumed
3. Rinse with a balanced salt solution (such as DPPS) that does not contain Calcium or Magnesium.
4. For [[Adherent Cells]], add a cell dissociation agent to detach the cells from the sheet. This should not be left in for too long, especially if it's not TrypLE.
5. If TrypLE is not used, a [[Trypsin]] inhibitor will also need to be added 
6. Cells should be transferred to a conical tube to centrifuge them to achieve a cell pellet.
7. New media is added
8. A small sample is removed to count the cells. Typically the amount is diluted with [[Trypan Blue]]
	1. using the microscope, the number of cells and dead cells are counted. Dead cells are completely blue while living cells are white/colourless.
	2. 
9. Amount is calculated to determine the amount of new cells needed, and that amount of medium is added to the cell culture.
10. Incubate the cells for the amount of time needed for optimal growth


Once cells are seeded, they experience exponential growth for a period of days after considered as the [[Log Phase]]. Once the cells cover the entire plate/exceed the medium density, they should be passaged once again.
