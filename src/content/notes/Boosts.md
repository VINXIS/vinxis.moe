Base speed is 18.75

When u get a boost it's basically any speed higher than that.

**BOOSTS ARE CUMULATIVE**
## Boost Sources
- [[Godspeed]]
- [[Fireball]]
- Shooting bullets
- Knifing bullets
- [[Neon White Water]] 
- [[Dominion]] rockets
- [[Book of Life]]
- [[Flower Enemies]]
## Bullet Boost Mechanism
- Shooting a bullet on the ground gives you more boost than when you shoot a bullet in the air
- Speed decay on the ground is faster than the speed decay in the air

|                 | Ground     | Air        |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Shooting Bullet | **Higher** | Lower      |
| Speed Decay     | Faster     | **Slower** |
Shooting multiple bullets simultaneously will also give u the boost of each bullet added onto each other (as said before, **boosts are cumulative**)

SO BASICALLY shoot bullets on the ground and then jump. U get a high boost and the speed decreases more slowly after
### Knifing
Knifing a bullet gives you the same boost as when you shoot it; HOWEVER, when you knife multiple bullets at the same time, it only gives u the same amount of boosts as knifing 1 bullet, which is unlike shooting bullets.
## Turning
Don't know why or how rly but if u turn in the air while still having a boost, ur speed will actually go **Lower** than 18.75. Idk why yet tho. This is most evident in a level like Cascade

Running on the ground ends up better since turning while running will not reduce your speed to lower than 18.75 in contrast
