Stem cells are a special type of [[Cell]]. This cell is the first type of cell usually found from e.g. fertilization, and are cells that have 2 primary properties:
- Self-renewal - Grow through many cycles while staying undifferentiated
- Potent - Can differentiate into 1 or multiple types of cells (aside for Extraembryonic Cells such as for placentas, which are an optional feature for stem cells)
Considered as a "neutral/default/initial" cell type.
