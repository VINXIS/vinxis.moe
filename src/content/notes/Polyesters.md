Contains an ester linkage that breaks off by [[Hydrolysis]]

The degradation rate of them can drastically vary by the chemical structure.

2 most common types are PLA and PGA

| PLA | PGA |
| --- | --- |
| Hydrophobic | Hydrophilic |
| Variable structure | Highly Crystalline |

Typically, copolymers of PLA and PGA called PLGA are used. Degradation rate changes drastically via the amount of PLA/PGA int he polymer.

A 100/0 composition will provide a very slow degradation rate, due to more crystallized regions.
A 50/50 composition will provide a very fast degradation rate, due to more amorphous regions.

These are [[Optically Active Materials]], they are able to change the direction of polarized light.
