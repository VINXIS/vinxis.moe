Biological Catalysts which speed up chemical reactions without changing the reaction itself. Typically Globular [[Protein]]s. Some [[Nucleic Acid]]s (a few [[Ribonucleic Acid]]s) can function as enzymes however.

There are 2 main types: [[Apoenzyme]] and [[Holoenzyme]], with the latter having a [[Prosthetic Group]]

[[Enzyme]]s are highly specific for reactions. Reverse reactions do not apply for the same [[Enzyme]]s. Compared to non-biological catalysts, they can:
- Speed up reaction rates by $10^6-10^{24}$
- Require milder conditions for reactions
- Very specific to reactions
- Can provide capacity regulations

[[Enzyme]]s will have active sites in their structure to help with catalysis and speeding up [[Reaction Rate]]s, there are 2 regions in a active site:
- [[Substrate Binding Region]]
- [[Catalytic Region]]

Polar [[Amino Acid]]s are the ones that typically exist around the [[Substrate Binding Region]]s
