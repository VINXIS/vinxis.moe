Overall charge of the protein of concern is typically defined by the pH:
- Low pH - Generally more positive
- High pH - Generally more negative

Regarding manufacturing poly(amino acid) materials, the pKa is usually referred to instead of pH due to the consideration of the [[Isoelectric Point]]

Generally when raising pK, the COOH is added, then NH3, then the functional group unique to the amino acid

**Albumin** is the most common protein in blood (about half of blood plasma). It's usually within the ~56 kDa with around 5 pH as its [[Isoelectric Point]]. 
When creating biomaterials, Albumin is a high priority to test regarding binding/degradation.

Hydrophilic amino acids would adsorb more.
Hydrophobic amino acids would adsorb more.

To calculate the hydrophobicity of a region, generally take the sum of the hydrophobicity values of a set of 10 amino acids, and shift the entire window by 1. Then chart the summations to visualize the regions.
(Originally intended to identify which regions were exposed to outside the cell membrane and which ones weren't in a given protein.)

When proteins adsorb to the material surface, they tend to denature (losing the enzyme functionality), which can cause unintended biological reactions to occur, such as the activation of fibrinogen to platelets to start clotting within the body.
