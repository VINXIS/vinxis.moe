Described by the [[Atomic Interaction]] relationship where the energy of a bond given a specific distance is:
$$\phi(r) = \epsilon_b\left[\left(\frac{r_e}{r}\right)^{12} - 2\left(\frac{r_e}{r}\right)^6\right]$$
The equilibrium distance for an atom is described with the following relationship:
$$r_e = 2^{\frac{1}{6}}\sigma$$
Where $\sigma$ is a **characteristic feature** for each element. With this relationship, $\phi(r)$ can be simplified to:
$$\phi(r) = 4\epsilon_b\left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6\right]$$
