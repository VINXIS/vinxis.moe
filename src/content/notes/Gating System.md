The Gating System in [[casting]] is used to control the flow of the melt used. 

A pouring basin stores the molten material created from heating.

A spruce is the vertical component that allows flow to a runner.

A runner is the horizontal component that reaches the gate.

A gate is open and closed to allow and disallow the flow of melt into the [[mold cavity]].
