Die casting forces its melt into high pressure within the mold used compared to other casting methods. This method is very expensive, and can only cast materials that do not go through secondary hardening processes, but it provides high precision/accuracy in sizing and produces casts rapidly, providing very little [[Supercooling]] and very few [[Dendrites]] to form.

Also known as [[Injection Molding]] for metals specifically; however, die casting typically cools much faster.

Die casting can be done as a colder process for high melting point alloys to mitigate the loss of corrosion resistance **excluding** ferrous alloys/steels.
