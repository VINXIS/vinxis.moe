Contact Length $(L)$ is the arc of the roller that is in contact with the material being rolled. This can be approximately determined as follows:
$$L=\sqrt{R(t_i-t_f)}$$
Using Contact Length, the [[Rolling Force]] and [[Rolling Torque]] can be calculated

The material observes the highest pressure from the roller at the middle of the contact length, and the lowest pressure on the edges
