Scheil Theory explains the behaviour observed during the solidification of materials with solutes and solvents within such as alloys.

In solidification, first an area with less solute will be formed, pushing the solute ahead of the liquid solid interface, causing [[Supercooling]], and forming an area with high solute, consequently creating another area of low solute, and it repeats.

Higher cooling rates can decrease [[Supercooling]] and decrease the sizes of these resulting areas.
