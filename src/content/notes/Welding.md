Welding is the process of liquifying metal to join parts together. Similar to [[Casting]], the process of welding undergoes liquifying metals in the process. As a result, [[Dendrites]] are formed.

When welding, the temperature gradient is very important in order to ensure that the cooling of the material does not cause defects/issues in strength such as the formation of [[Dendrites]].

[[Rosenthal Heat Flow]] is one of the means of measuring the heat flow through a weld.

To observe/calculate temperature gradients and temperatures at points of the weld pool, [[Adam's 2-D Heat Equation]] can be utilized for this.
