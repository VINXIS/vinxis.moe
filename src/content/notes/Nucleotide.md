[[Monomer]]s that consist of a Nitrogen base, a [[Sugar]], and a Phosphate [[Functional Group]]. Joining them forms [[Nucleic Acid]].

These exist anywhere in life, and are known to be used for:
- O-R reactions
- Energy Transfer
- Intracellular Signalling
- Biosynthetic Reactions
- Storage and decoding genetic information
- Enzymes (though typically done by [[Protein]]s instead)

These can be are high energy molecules (such as [[NTP]]s) and [[Electron Carrier]]s alongside being [[Nucleic Acid]]s.

Nucleotides are a combination of a [[Nucleoside]] and a [[Phosphate]], and the naming is usually the [[Nucleoside]] + number of phosphates + phosphate, and the phosphate is linked with a [[Phosphoester Bond]]

Adenosine triphosphate is Adenine + [[Ribose]] + 3 [[Phosphate]]s (ATP)

If it was [[Deoxyribose]] then the naming is dATP
