Alternative Splicing is when splicing options can occur where it is not solely [[Introns]] being removed from a site in a [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid]]

There are various forms of splicing. Imagine a theoretical sequence:
`E1---I1---E2---I2---E3---I3---E4`
where E is Exon and I is Intron.

1. Exon Skipping - This is when [[Exons]] are potentially removed alongside the [[Introns]] surrounding them. E.g. `E1-E3-E4`
2. Mutually Exclusive Exons - This is when 1 of 2 [[Exons]] may be removed, but they both cannot stay at the same time after splicing occurs. E.g. `E1-E2-E4` vs `E1-E3-E4`
3. Alternative 5' Donor / 3' Acceptor Sites - Alternative areas within [[Introns]]/[[Exons]] can be used to splice from where some parts of the [[Exons]] may be removed as if that part was an intron, or some parts of the [[Introns]] may be retained as if that part is an exon. Imagine Exons split as `E1a|E1b---I1...` for these examples.
	1. 5' Donor sites would remove from the left side of the intron site `E1b-E2-E3-E4`
	2. 3' Acceptor sites would remove from the right side of the intron site `E1-E2a-E3-E4`
4. Intron Retention - Sometimes [[Introns]] in their entirety can be retained. `E1-E2-I2-E3-E4`
5. Cryptic Exons - [[Introns]] that end up treated as [[Exons]] mistakenly

Various [[Splice Factor]]s can cause massive changes to the alternative splicing that occurs during the [[Ribonucleic Acid Splicing]] stage
