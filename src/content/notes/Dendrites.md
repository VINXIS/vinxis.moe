Dendrites are crystal structure that exhibit the visual characteristics of trees. These are typically caused by preferred growth directions from nucleation due to material [[Anisotropy]] or due to different directions of crystallographic planes.

There are various forms of dendrites that are formed:
- [[Cellular Dendrites]]
- [[Equiaxed Dendrites]]
