RNA transcription is the first part of [[Gene Expression]].

It is the process of creating RNAs by copying parts of DNA into RNA sequences. If the RNAs are used for encoding/creating proteins, then they are called [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid]], otherwise they are considered as [[Non-Coding Ribonucleic Acid]]s.

The [[Dioxyribonucleic Acid]] is read by a [[Polymerase]] to produce an antiparallel RNA, which is usually called the primary transcript. This primary transcript creates the [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid]]s and [[Non-Coding Ribonucleic Acid]]s
