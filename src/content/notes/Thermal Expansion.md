Materials experience stresses depending on thermal conditions such as expansion, compression, etc.

This expansion can be described by the [[Lennard-Jones Potential]] for 1-D and 3-D
1-D: $$
\alpha_L=\frac{1}{L}\frac{dL}{dT}$$where $L$ is length

3-D:$$\alpha_V=\frac{1}{V}\frac{dV}{dT}=3\alpha_L$$ where $V$ is volume
