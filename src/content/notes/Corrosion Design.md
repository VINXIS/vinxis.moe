Corrosion Design is designing materials with the intent of mitigating corrosion with its design as much as possible. A few factors are typically considered for corrosion design, such as
1. Material type used, and its resistance to corrosion
2. Not allowing water to collect in the design
3. Cause drips off of the material with drip skirts
4. Not allow vapor to condensate by rounding internal edges
5. Selecting materials close to each other within the galvanic series to prevent [[Galvanic Corrosion]]
6. Sealing crevices between different parts to prevent [[Crevice Corrosion]]
7. Reducing impingement and velocity/turbulence to prevent [[Erosion Corrosion]]
8. Reduce notches and grooves, and smooth/round edges to reduce stresses which can cause [[Stress Corrosion Cracking]]
