The backbones of [[Nucleic Acid]]s.

When [[Nucleoside Base]]s are connected to a [[Sugar]]. The carbon connected in the [[Sugar]] ring is generally labelled as 1' for counting. 1 is in the [[Nucleoside Base]].

These are typically named by the base + osine if Purine-sub and base + idine if Pyrimidine-sub, with deoxy in front if [[Deoxyribose]] is used. 

Examples:
Adenine + [[Ribose]] = Adenosine
Uracil + [[Deoxyribose]] = Deoxyuridine
