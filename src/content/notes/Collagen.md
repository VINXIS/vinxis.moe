Protein typically found from connective tissues, such as tendons, skin, etc.)

There are around **28 types** of collagen for different connective properties

Only **Type 1** collagen (aka tropocollagen) is commercially/industrially viable. It is the only one that can be processed in large quantities, and isolate. It is primarily found in:
- Skin (Relatively impure)
- Tendons (Relatively pure)
Industries mainly uses skin due to its availability.

Type 2 is typically found in cartilage areas. Type 4 is found in the [[Extracellular Matrix]]

Other collagen types aside for type 1 is extracted and used, but they are more research/small-scale based.

## Structure
A protein that is comprised of 3 polypeptides. 
Each polypeptide is formed as (-Gly-X-Y) where X is typically Proline, and Y is typically Hyp, but both can typically be any other amino acid aside for Gly.

~1/3 of residues ends up as Gly.

The triple helix formed is a quaternery structure type.

2 of the helices are $\alpha_1$, and another one is $\alpha_2$.
2 genes create the triple helix structure.

Collagen typically consits of around ~240 $\epsilon$-amino groups, and ~230 carboxyl groups.

### Telopeptides
The regions where intermolecular crosslinks are formed. This is usually considered as the allysine area of collagen, and is at the N and C-terminus.

## Production Stages:
1. Collagen is translated in the RER
2. Then modified in the Golgi and ER
3. IT ends up into a triple helix with a C and N terminus.
4. The terminus get cleaved, leaving the triple helix.
5. The collagen then assemble themselves
6. The assembly then assemble together themselves as well.

## Sources
Type 1 Collagen is primarily sourced industrial-wise from:
- Cows (Mainly used)
- Pigs
- Fish (Cleaner tissues)
- Cell culture growth

The collagen is also isolated using the following methods:
- Salt-soluble collagen (0.15-2 M NaCl sol.)
- Acid-soluble collagen (0.5 M acetic acid or HCl with 2-3 pH sol.)
- Pepsin-soluble collagen
Salt/acid extracts ~2% only
The remaining ~98% is from enzyme cleavage

To use collagen, you need to [[Crosslink]] in order to improve:
- processability
- control of degradation in vivo
- immunogenicity reduction

## Production
There are 5 crosslinking methods. 2 Chemical, 2 Physical, and 1 Biological.

### Dehydrothermal Crosslinking
Has an advantage of not needing any chemical reagents.
It also gives a clean material.

By dehydrating the collagen scaffolds, you are able to favor crosslinking. Removing the water causes the equilibrium to favour the crosslinking reaction.

It does create a very strong material in cases, which makes it inviable for many applications that does not want very strong materials.

Cytotoxicity is possible depending on the simplicity of the dialdehyde used. A more complex dialdehyde can cause a chance of antibody reactions to occur.

Linkages are amine bonds

### EDC/NHS (Carbodiimides Crosslinking)
Linkages are amide (peptide bonds)

Side products can be formed, such as Urea.

### Epoxides
An oxygen connected to 2 carbons, creating a triangle linkage.

### Purpose of different crosslinks

Different processing methods well provide different collagen with peptide/amine/carboxyl groups.
Some methods are cleaner than others/more impure.

Degradation rates are also quite different depending on which crosslinking agent is used as well.

## Sterilization Effects
Many forms of sterlization end up degrading/destroying collagen, as well as condensing fibres in areas together.
Ethanol is the mildest method, and that still has aggregation/condensation occurring.

Most of these forms effect the material properties of the collagen, such as the elasticity (increases), stability (decreases), strength (decreases), etc.

Ethanol and gas plasma have very little effect. Harsher methods can sterilize it better, but will still effect the structure.

## Isolation

At low pH, concentrations of H+ is very high. In such an environment, NH2 -> NH3+, and COO- -> COOH. This allows for the collagen to loosen up and isolate.

Pepsin allows to reorder and re-organize a condensed/aggregated structure as well to purify and clean it.
