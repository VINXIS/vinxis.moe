## Introduction
1. Materials are defined by their structure
2. We then process the given structure, essentially making it
3. We then have different structural properties. Looping back to 1.

The performance of a material is manifested by its properties

## Classifications of [[Materials Processing]]
There are 100s of different forms of [[Materials Processing]] that can be decided from depending on what forms of manipulation wanted.

# Finals Study
[[Materials Processing]] is important for the manufacture and defining characteristics of materials in general. There are many different kinds of processes with many different uses.

[[Forging]] can be better than [[Machining]] or [[Grinding]] for cases where extra improvements to strength and toughness are required while shaping a material. [[Machining]] and [[Grinding]] do not affect the microstructures of a material, only the shape. 

[[Machining]] and [[Grinding]] may be best used in scenarios where either improvements to strength and toughness are not necessary, or if it is more cost effective. It is also far more precise, providing cleaner shape result.

[[Stamping]] shears the material via a press, and has the benefit over [[Casting]] where the process does not require the heating/melting of the material, and is much faster. Stamping can also provide a nicer finish.

[[Casting]] may be more beneficial in cases where the entire material shape needs to be reconstructed instead of changing the shape of a surface, or if a larger area needs to be shaped.

[[Scheil Theory]] extensively explains the solidification process in methods like [[Casting]] regarding [[Supercooling]] and [[Dendrites]] formation

[[Chvironiv's Rule]] also outlines the relationship and dimensions of [[Casting]] with cooling times

There are also multiple parts to a [[Casting]] machine which consist of handling the melt, handling the shape of the mold, and pattern.

[[Injection Molding]] is a very important type of [[Casting]] used for the shaping of polymers. For metals, it is referred to as [[Die Casting]].

[[Injection Molding]] consists of 3 stages, with a sealing point within the second stage. Its cooling rate is related to wall thickness and temperatures of the initial melt, final polymer, and mold.

The main method of analysis for this class regarding [[Deformation]] is via [[Upper Bound Analysis]]

One of the biggest types of [[Deformation]] used on materials is [[Rolling]]. There are multiple types of [[Rolling]] used in many industries.

To convert powders into standardized block sizes of a material to undergo deformation, [[Powder Compacting]] and [[Sintering]] are the most common methods of processes.

[[Welding]] is the process of joining parts together by heating metal into liquid and forming joints.
