A [[Neon White Card]] that gives you a fuckass shotgun for shooting, and a boost in any direction otherwise
## Boost
The boost that fireball gives is weaker in terms of the amount of speed it gives compared to [[Godspeed]], but it allows you to aim it in any direction vertically and horizontally

Similar to [[Godspeed]], it also goes back up a little in speed after the first decay phase and then gradually decreasing again

If you touch the ground while still in the boost state, it will play a [[Neon White Water]] sound effect, while also adding an extra boost too. Pretty sure it goes all the way up to 33.7 like in water, but I dont actually know for sure

Unlike [[Neon White Water]], u dont get a boost when jumping again
## Interactions
 [[Book of Life]]ing to something near a door will still keep the door breaking effect it has. This becomes very obvious in a level like Breakthrough.

[[Stomp]]s can be cancelled with a [[Fireball]] trigger
