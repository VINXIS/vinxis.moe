## Introduction
Particle sizes and distances between particles of different phases may provide more strength to materials. [[Inclusions]] do not provide such strength.

The smaller the grain sizes and distances between particles, the stronger the material will become.

## Stress and Strain

The [[Stress]] ($\sigma$) and [[Strain]] ($\epsilon$) that materials can go through are very important properties of materials to consider in engineering situations.

**Volume is always conserved**, so when a material undergoes **[[plastic deformation]]**, $$A_0l_0=A_il_i$$As a result:
$$
\begin{align}

\sigma_{\text{true}}= \sigma_{\text{eng}}(1+\epsilon_{\text{eng}})
\end{align}
$$
Again, only when it **undergoes [[plastic deformation]]**.

[[Shear Stress]] and [[Shear Strain]] however are different from other $\sigma$ stresses as these are regarding **parallel** forces instead of perpendicular relative to the surface in question.

Microstructures do not have an effect on **[[elastic deformation]]**.

The [[Elasticity]] of a material is dependant on the [[Atomic Interaction]] of a material. As the temperature increases, the [[Atomic Interaction]] becomes weaker, which causes a decrease in the [[Elasticity]] a material has. The [[Plasticity]] on the other hand is not necessarily related to the [[Atomic Interaction]]. 

Both stresses abide by [[Hooke's Law]] where $\sigma=E\epsilon$ and $\tau=F\delta$, and E is [[Young's Modulus]] while F is [[Shear Modulus]].

## Tensile Test
The [[Tensile Test]] creates a [[Stress-Strain Curve]] which allows multiple properties of a material to be discovered.
