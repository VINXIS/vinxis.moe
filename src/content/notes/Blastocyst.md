Blastocysts are structures found in mammals shortly after fertilization. When the embryo is approximately around 100 cells or so, it creates a structure with a massive cavity primarily containing [[Stem Cell]]s.

These were initially used for [[In Vitro Fertilization]], but have also be used in research and cell culturing for various regenerative cell types.
