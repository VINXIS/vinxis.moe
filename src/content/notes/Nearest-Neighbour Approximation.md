An approximation to calculate [[Bond Energy]] using the heat of a transition phase. It can be used to calculate other solid interactions such as the [[Young's Modulus]].

**THIS DOES NOT CONSIDER [[Long-Range Interactions]]. 
OVER 15% ERROR OCCURS.**

For the **heat of [[Sublimation]]** or **cohesive energy** (J/mol) required is:
$$\Delta H_s = E_b = \frac{1}{2}zN_a\epsilon_b$$
Where if all bonds are broken, you can create a solid to a gas. The calculation of the energy needed to break all bond energies in a mol. is the result of heat of sublimation per mol.
$E_b$ = binding energy
$z$ = [[coordination number]] for atom (Ex. BCC: z = 8)
$N_a$ = Avogadro's Number

In a nearest-neighbour approximation, the heat of [[Vaporization]] is 90% the [[coordination number]] of a solid when it is a liquid.
$$\Delta H_v = E_b = \frac{1}{2}(0.9z)N_a\epsilon_b$$
