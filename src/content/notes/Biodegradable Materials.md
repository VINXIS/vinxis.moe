**Biodegradable Materials** are materials that are broken down by proteins that adsorb to it.

[[Collagen]] is one type

Good for short term applications to degrade once the material is done for use.
Also good for long term applications to provide aid in regeneration and repeat use without much toxic adversity
Top uses:
- Surgical Tools
- Pharmacology
- Tissue Regeneration

Different forms of degrading:
- **Degradation:** Chemical break down
- **Fragmentation:** Physical deleterious changes
- **Biodegradation:** Cell-mediated break down
- **Bioresorbable:** Total excretion/assimilation to body

Other features need to be considered aside for the [[Biodegradation]] of a material, such as toxicity, immunogenicity, and carcinogenicity.

Different materials have vastly different degradation rates for different applications.

Most common forms are [[Polyesters]] since they are far more cheap and readily available than other types. The lecture slide has all forms of materials

Most biological systems are [[Optically Active Materials]], and they are L. This allows materials that are D to be distinguished.

Some factors that control the degradation are:
- Chemical Stability
	- Anhydride > Ester > Amide in speed
	- Ions accelerate hydrolysis
		- Degradation with added ions generated can accelerate even more
- Hydrophobicity/Hydrophilicity
- Enzyme susceptibility
- Morphology 
	- Amorphous morphology degrades faster than crystalline morphology
	- More sidechain carbons causes more chain motion/amorphous and increase degradation
	- Very fast at first, then much slower later
- polymer molecular weight
- geometry

A lot of the slides are within the paper linked as well
