Poisson's Ratio ($\nu$) describes the effect of deformation on an [[isotropic]] material that occurs on one axis affecting another axis where
$$\nu=\frac{\epsilon_{\text{trans}}}{\epsilon_{\text{axial}}}$$

Where $\epsilon_{\text{trans}}$ is the adjacent axis the surface is on, and $\epsilon_{\text{axial}}$ is the axis the surface where the force is acting on
