#Zaregoto 
An artistic genius known even by people outside of the artistic field. She has golden hair and blue eyes, and wears dresses that you would see on a french doll as well as jewelery that cost more than human bodies would on the black market. 

She used to be blind until recently, and expected the real world just like she imagined.
