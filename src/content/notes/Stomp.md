A [[Neon White Card]] that legit gives the worst fuckin g gun in teh game, oh and also a ground pound

## Ground Pound / Stomp
Triggering the effect will basically make u drop at -70 downwards; obviously u can also break some platforms with it basically anything that has the asme textures as breakable doors/walls

U cannot trigger multiple at the same time

Immediaetly when 1 stomp ends tho u can trigger the next 1
## Interactions

[[Stomp]]s can be cancelled by [[Elevate]], [[Godspeed]], [[Fireball]], and [[Book of Life]].

A caveat with [[Elevate]]: u can cancel the ground pounding, but u will still drop at -70 speed

Stomping a [[Purify]] will also trigger a bomb earlier if u stomp/ground pound on it

#unconfirmed [[Stomp]]s can maybe get cancelled by [[Dominion]]'s grapple as well(?)
