The Flory-Huggins theory is a [[Lattice Model]] that tries to describe the [[Thermodynamics]] of mixing a [[Polymer]] with a solvent, such as adding water to a sponge.

I'll add sources later but basically from wikipedia rn the main equation for [[Gibbs Free Energy]] is
$$ \Delta G_mix = RT[n_1\ln\phi_1+n_2\ln\phi_2+n_1\phi_2\chi_{12}]$$
Where 1 is solvent stuff and 2 is polymer stuff and n is amount in molecules and phi is volume fraction and chi is the polymer solvent parameter they introduced for the equation
