High molecular weight substances with chain-like molecules that have atoms linked covalently

Different classifications based on different types of [[Monomer]]s binded (homo, co, ter, e.t.c.) to create [[Polymer]]s usable for biological purposes.

Polydispersity (PD) is the amount of heterogeneity in polymers based on molecular weight. Min. value is 1 and it means pure homogeneity.

Polymers can increase fluid viscosity more so than small molecules.

Relative viscosity $\eta_r=\frac{\eta}{\eta_0}$ is viscosity relevant to the initial solvent state.
Specific viscosity $\eta_{sp}=\eta_r-1$ is the increase in viscosity due to the polymer presence.
Intrinsic viscosity $[\eta]$ is the viscosity of the polymer where polymer-polymer interactions don't exist.

Mark-Houwink Relationship: $[\eta]=KM^a$ where K and a are constants, and M is the viscosity average molecular weight (between the most common occurring molecular weight, and the average molecular weight)

Crystalline regions are more uniform in shape with consistent bends and straight areas.
Amorphous regions are more erratic, complex, or random in shape.

Materials change from brittle to elastic properties at the [[Glass Transition Temperature]] ($T_g$). 
A straight jump in heat intake for crystalline polymers
A more vertical slope in heat intake (but continuous) for amorphous polymers
