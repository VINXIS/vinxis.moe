[[Cell]] stress occurs when the cell experiences errors in function due to various factors, ranging from cytotoxic substances to adverse environments. The responses to stress by cells depends on the type and intensity of the stresses provided onto the cells. They can be categorised as such<sup>[1]</sup>:
- [[Heat Shock Response]]
- [[Unfolded Protein Response]]
- [[DNA Damage Response]]
- [[Oxidative Stress Response]]

Depending on the resolution of the stress for the cell, it will either activate pro-survival signalling pathways, or cell death signalling pathways to [[Cell Death]]

Cell stress experiments are to understand how cells react to adverse conditions that they may be put in depending on control/certain additional factors/adjustments that one may put onto cells.

The purpose is in order to see their efficacy depending on certain adjustments made, or to set up cellular environments to study therapeutic interventions for cancer, or chronic conditions, or to study cellular [[Homeostasis]] in action.

Common types of cellular stress experiments are:
