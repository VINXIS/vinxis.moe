Rolling Force is the force required to cause the deformation of a material through [[Rolling]]. This can be calculated via the relationship of [[Contact Length]] and [[Flow Stress]] by the following:
$$F=Y_fwL$$
Where $w$ is the width of the material

This can be used to determine the required [[Rolling Torque]] as well.
