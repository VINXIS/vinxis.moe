Hooke's Law describes the relationship between [[Stress]], [[Strain]] and [[Modulus]] where:
$$
\begin{align}
	\tau&=F\delta \\
	\sigma&=G\epsilon
\end{align}
$$
Where F and G are [[Shear Modulus]] and [[Young's Modulus]] respectively.

Regarding different directions, [[Poisson's Ratio]] ($\nu$) describes the ratio between how stresses in different directions affect each other to where for [[Strain]]:
$$\epsilon_{xx} = \frac{\sigma_{xx}}{E} - \nu\frac{\sigma_{yy}}{E} - \nu\frac{\sigma_{zz}}{E} = \frac{\sigma_{xx}-\nu(\sigma_{yy}+\sigma_{zz})}{E}$$
While for each [[Shear Strain]]:
$$\delta_{xy}=\frac{\tau_{xy}}{G}$$
