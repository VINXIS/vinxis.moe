#Zaregoto
An island which is run by a disowned member of the [[Akagami Foundation]] named [[Iria Akagami]]. The current location of this island is currently unknown, but it may be possible that this island is in the [[Kanto Region]] as the base of the foundation's operations are there, or by [[Kyoto]] as that is where [[Ii]] stated he lives at. 

# Naming
Wet Crow could possibly refer to [[Iria Akagami]] herself as becoming wet through means of oils can cause crows to not fly since she herself is supposedly not able to travel outside of the island.

The crow's "Feather Island" could mean that her feathers are the island itself, surrounding her just like the feathers surround a crow.
