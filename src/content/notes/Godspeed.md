A [[Neon White Card]] that gives you a rifle for shooting, and a boost straight forward otherwise
## Boost
The boost itself starts at a speed of 120, and then quickly decays

After the first decay phase though it goes back up a little, before it begins a more gradual decay from 37

Frame-by-frame data: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/noaglaw4ia

When requiring sequential godspeeds to cover some distance, like in the level Godspeed (lol), the time between godspeeds should be interspersed evenly
## Interactions
#unconfirmed triggering the [[Godspeed]] boost before quickly [[Book of Life]]ing to something near a door will still keep the door breaking effect it has; speculating based on [[Fireball]] x [[Book of Life]]

[[Stomp]]s can be cancelled with a [[Godspeed]] trigger
