Gene expression is the process of which the information from a [[Molecular Gene]] is used for synthesising and producing end products such as proteins/[[Ribonucleic Acid]] provide a phenotype.

There are 3 primary steps for gene expression to occur:
1. [[Ribonucleic Acid Transcription]]
2. [[Ribonucleic Acid Splicing]]
3. [[Ribonucleic Acid Translation]]
