Rolling is the process of reducing a materials thickness by compressing the material under a set of rolls, ultimately thinning and strengthening a material.

Since volume rates are typically the same before and after a material undergoes rolling, the following equation is produced:
$$t_iw_iv_i=t_fw_fv_f$$
- $t$ is material thickness
- $w$ is material width
- $v$ is the velocity
- $i$ is initial
- $f$ is final

The [[Rolling Draft]] of a material is the difference in thickness, and each roller has a maximum possible draft depending on the friction coefficient and the radius of the roller.

If a given [[Rolling Draft]] is possible, the [[Contact Length]] of the roller with the material is required, which can calculate the [[Rolling Force]], [[Rolling Torque]], and [[Rolling Power]] that is necessary to achieve the desired [[Rolling Draft]]

A [[Sendzimir Mill]] is a very common type of roller used in manufacturing industries since its nature can provide very high strength steels as a result. This also mitigates roll flattening and bending by reducing [[Contact Length]].
Larger [[Contact Length]] = Larger chance for flattening/bending of the material
