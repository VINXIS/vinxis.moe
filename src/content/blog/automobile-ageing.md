<small>I just want to preface that I don't actually like the word grifter it's actually kind of a useless fucking word but I use it a bit here because I am ANGYYYYY!!!! Also wanna know another useless word? Hypocrisy. Want to know another? Integrity. Another? Morality. Ok this is for another post tbh (maybe idk i kinda dont feel like talking about this)

Also I use aging and ageing interchangeably cuz it doesnt matter</small>

# Our State On Roads

When you put humans in a human formicarium and let it sit for a good 300000 years or so (give or take a couple 100000 years to that... considering there is no consensus apparently)[^1] [^2], then you will end up with that formicarium very likely to have ~20% of it covered in shitty fucking concrete pavement everywhere, and the other 80% in relatively ridiculously tiny patches [^3]. It would be fascinating to look at as a spectacle; in a way, it would be beautiful seeing how these little human creatures swarm around and quickly alter their landscape after so many years of nothing happening in it, I guess. Let's be real though if you saw that in your little tiny human ant exhibit, it would also likely be something you might consider as: GRAVE DANGER FOR YOUR PET HUMANS.

Ok I'm done with that human ant analogy it's a bit weird but hopefully it draws a picture I want you to imagine to some degree. For how much we have covered so much of the land with roads, it would be silly to think there would be no effects on anything as a result. It's not the point of this post, but with very few large patches of land as a result of how the roads were built, ALONGSIDE the amount of land already covered, there is obvious results of biodiversity loss [^3] [^4] [^5] [^6], inequality of various factors (such as economic, racial, and social inequalities) generally indirectly correlated to (but also directly caused by) road development [^7] [^8] [^9], the Perceived Accessibility for people also greatly diminishes [^10], etc etcet cetcetcetcetc and so on.

# Aged Like Milk

You may or may not have heard of Bryan Johnson [^11] [^12], a billionaire who, like a few others (cough cough Jeff Bezos) have started to get REALLLYYY into this idea of getting to live forever. Billionaires like Johnson send ridiculous amounts of money from their net worth to get as optimized of a lifestyle regimen as possible [^13], regardless of how scientifically dubious some of the methods may be (o u kno...........Just A Developing Process). They then try to hope that this will make them live longer. Supposedly, some of them want to live at least as long enough for what they say will be the point where aging will "no longer be an issue" that they very confidently claim will occur in our lifetimes [^14].

The initial reason I started writing this post actually is based on an article by The New Yorker [^15] (which I found from a video by Angela Collier [^16]). Shoutouts. The article is very good, it references the quintessential biogerontology paper published by Cell about the Hallmarks of Aging (published in 2013 [^17], but also updated for 2023 [^18]), and then explains as to how the current trends in popular biotech by "Biohackers" have subsequently bastardized the discourse, and ruined everything <3 Yay! (though I should note that the article is generally focused on shitting on 1 billionaire. There are very good points brought by the article as a result of it though)

It's just all so fucking depressing for [/ME](https://vinxis.moe/me), who very much likes and enjoys biogerontology and aging (reversal/slowing) work. I share similar fears to death as everyone else, even probably close to these shitty fucking billionaires too. During COVID, some point in July 2020 (while I was scrapping the bottom of the fucking barrel in my shit ass introductory Organic Chemistry class for university), I had a really terrible panic attack; I felt a ridiculous sharp pain on my left chest, thinking it was a heart attack (it wasn't), and for a few days, the panic attack's effects lingered. I was still freaking out from time to time around then thinking that I was going to die soon and it was all going to be over. Frankly, after doing a shitton of tests that were thankfully free bcuz free healthcare, it was likely just to be muscle pain lol...

Basically in the beginning of 2020 I started working out like CRAZY and lost so much weight, and then shortly after COVID started I rebounded all the way back. Naturally this was really because of just very drastic body composition changes for the worse with muscle mass loss, moreso than anything SUPER serious.

Regardless, this initially brought me to the interest to the ideals of "living forever". The only mention I heard of before this was idk like some fucking shitty Veritasium video (there are good Veritasium videos, but there are A LOT of bad ones man ): ) where he gets a scientist named David Sinclair to talk about how he has done amazing work on mice and overhyping the shit out of it [^19], only to basically find out over the decades he basically just tried to create a bunch of biotech firms and constantly fail as he keeps pushing overhyped pop science [^20] [^21].  I wouldn't really go so far as Angela does in her video [^16] and call him a full blown grifter, especially because he has contributed significant and what I easily consider as non-trivial science to the field since, but it really doesn't help that such people like him that do contribute some decent to the field do a lot of silly things.

Augh I used to be like god damnnn this Sinclair guy kinda pops off (and even tried to email him a few times) until like a year or so after I found out that a lot of the stuff is kinda just idk.... sad I guess

# Priorities and The Intersection

These people really don't understand. While drunk in the shitty fucking competition they have made health over the course of the decades, some things in health will stay the same regardless. The base factors still matter, if not, more than almost all research done in the field.
- Stress
- Diet
- Exercise
- Cleanliness

Both of these cases of getting more roads on the planet and researching ridiculous bullshit in aging allow for a very easy way actually to just subsidize rich people at the cost of poorer people. Paying millions for interventions alongside efforts displacing people from easier access to healthcare; paying millions for roadwork alongside displacing people from their original places. The life expectancy for poorer people is far worse than for richer people [^22] [^23], and yet the accessibility for the "groundbreaking research" in longevity is strictly gated by economics. The locations with better access to everything, locations that would greatly benefit normal people as they require such services like the god damn supermarket for cheap food MUCH MORE, become overpriced due to the layout of cities [^24], and basically only accessible to far richer people.

Personally I also think driving is a waste of time because you have to put your full attention onto driving, and you can't do something else while you're like just chilling in a train like writing some shit or noting down things ur thinking of very easily for later and stuff... but it's obviously not just that

Very easily put, driving removes the inherent ability of going to your destination using your body. You don't walk to the station, or to your destination. You can't bike to where you want to go. Poorer people being priced out of places (that would have much higher chances of perceived accessibility) means that they are removed from THE VERY BASIC FORM of exercise that could easily exist for them.

You may have also heard of road rage? A significant stressor by nature! Driving helps getting stressed so you can live shorter for no reason [^25]! Surely this is a worse factor to be fearful of regarding death than, say, a random fucking serial killer in the train and ohh man there's random fuckin people bro or whatever other bullshit Elon Musk likes to say about public transport [^26]. Man cars don't even take you where you want either it just takes you to where you need to park lol

MAN IT KINDA SEEMS LIKE THEY WANT US TO DIE BY FORCING US TO USE FUCKING SHITTY CARS?

So annoying how these people will talk about "wanting to live long enough until aging is 'solved'" and yet everything is just a fucking short term solution. What are you talking about, what is the point of being "immortal" on a dying planet, and how can you be striving for immortality when you're focusing WAY TOO MUCH on the most recent paper results for actual goals, with no look into sustainable measures as well to ensure that your "immortality" methods can truly keep you "immortal". Eating 2385947249852 pills and constantly checking your "clocks" that never show the whole picture is actually not sustainable!

Also fuck off calling aging "either a hardware problem or a software problem" Diamantis holy fucking shit [^15].

# Crossroads

LITERALLY within A MONTH of little old me in the peak of COVID looking into the field of biogerontology made me realize that it's kinda just sad as hell. If "defeating aging" is so important, AND FRANKLY, I THINK IT IS, then why are we wasting SO much time on these hyper-individualistic factors like spending 2 million dollars on supplements with scientifically dubious sources? Why is most of the research and work NOT trying to figure out how we can get EVEN THE FUNDAMENTALS that are much more important to aging as high as ever possible as a choice for everyone?

There is a very obvious crossroads with a very obvious shitty cancerous tumor sticking out as a result when you just quickly look at the similarities of both cases. Quite funny considering cancerous tumors are usually a sign of hyperactivity in the opposite direction for the hallmarks of aging [^18]. I'm not really a super anti-individualist person, nor am I the one to be an instigator to the ideologue...I have a similar level of qualms and assurances to collectivism anyway. The thing is though that the intersection between both, the state of biogerontology, and the state of city planning, are festered with this disease.

I'm gonna be honest, it really seems like what I thought was the case before for years. Systemic issues need to be dealt with for aging research to have any purpose to it. Systemic issues like the roads we have plastered everywhere on the planet lol. I am quite convinced that a conversion to city planning that is far more reliant on other modes of transportation compared to cars would allow us to require far less roads, which in turn provides many social cultural and environmental benefits, while also quite directly improving even the basic tenants of longer living by less potential factors of stress and more potential factors of basic exercise. Those social cultural and environmental benefits will also directly apply to the basic tenants too.

Unfortunately however, such blasphemy with anti-individualist rhetoric is not viable because it's simply just not profitable. OH WELL xP I am hoping to move to Switzerland or Japan sooner than later anyway so Lawl.

But seriously, we really need to kill this tumor. In case it hasn't been obvious at this point in the post, the tumor is obviously fucking capitalism. More specifically, it's the notion of hyper-individualism that festers as a result of capitalism itself [^27] [^28]. I am a big proponent of doing literally anything that goes against this, because I think they are all not only fighting against the core issue, but will also help with your own longevity if you so desire; whether it be, you know, and you have probably heard some of these time and time again but I'm listing them anyway:
- Advocating for other modes of transport like biking infra and public transport and walking places
- Advocating to kill zoning
- Spamming the shit out of representatives and suggesting others to do it
- Giving some good ideas to representatives
- Creating art with friends!!!
- Community work and events
- Setting up social events online or in person
- Putting up free stuff outside for people
- Unironically go vegan if u can im not even joking
- Forcing discussion on these various intersections that exist `(THERE ARE MANY MORE, PELASE STOP TALKING ABOUT JUST CRYPTO/AI ALREADY WHAT IS WRONG WITH ALL OF YOU PEOPLE ONLINE PARROTING OFF EACH OTHER SAYING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND NEVER DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT JUST TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK OFF YOUTUBE AD REVENUE, ALAS THE GRIFTERS COMPLAIN ABOUT GRIFTERS? O_o)`
- PLEASE TALK ABOUT THINGS TO DO INSTEAD OF FUCKING CRYPTO/AI FOR THE 23589234589TH TIME AGAIN PLEASE GIVE MORE THINGS TO DO GIVE SUGGESTIONS TO ME EVEN ILL ADD THEM HERE
Or you know.... more..... uh..... **radical** stuff too! :)
I am definitely an advocate for whatever "radical" means :)
Just make sure you are as anonymous as possible while doing them :) 

Regardless, **mutual aid** and **direct action** are beautiful. Anything that can be spanned within the ideals of mutual aid and direct action will help. ANYTHING you think of within those 2 realms of ideas will help.

We need to start there.

The research is definitely useful, and it obviously shouldn't stop, but all of the research in aging that we will ever do is ultimately useless if the core foundation and tenants aren't even solvable and available for people.

Let's do this!!!!! Please!!!!!!! Help!!!!!!!!!!!m PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!!@!@!!!@!@
