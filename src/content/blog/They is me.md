## **THERE ARE NO SPOILERS ON THE EVENTS THAT OCCUR**
## **THERE ARE SPOILERS ON WHAT HOUSEKI NO KUNI IS ABOUT**
## **PLEASE READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

It has been 2 nights since I read [Land of the Lustrous/Houseki no Kuni](https://hnk.rocks) and it has traumatized me.

I asked a couple friends what they thought of the ending, if they thought it was a happy or sad ending, e.t.c. **Obviously** the answer is neither: it's simply a perfect ending; however, I am forced to mark the ending as one of them for myself... and to me, I am forced to label it as a sad one.

It's so absurd; a piece of media has never made me feel this way before. Since I finished HnK, I have cried to myself for at least a total of 6 hours in the past 48. I also reread the last 2 volumes yesterday, and could not sleep at all last night. Hours of crying were experienced alongside my contemplation over both: what I just read, and my relationships with people. My blood pressure had raised to 140/90 over the course of the past couple days while reading and thinking about it again.

I have also been thinking about my own creative process as well: how much lacking it is compared to HnK, and how I need to start picking up the fucking pace in order to get anywhere. This story has told me to go fuck myself in a multitude of ways, and it's amazing, but fuck is it so fucking stressful and traumatizing to experience.

So much has been learnt over the past 2 days that would take me years.

I have realized that I need to be gentler, and kinder with the people around me. My assumptions and framing of the relationships with certain people that I am around for many hours of the day felt so wrong after reading this manga. It felt like I was doing something so terrible to them by acting how I was. There was a call for me to start becoming more of a driver in our connections, and to invest much more effort into them, instead of none. If nothing ends up well... I can at least say that I tried. That I tried so fucking hard to work on them.

I realized that I truly cannot make myself forgive certain things yet. There are things in the past that happened, either by me or by someone else, that have caused such extensive damage. I have been pretending for so long that I don't hold resentment, and that I have forgiven them for what they have done to me, but the truth of the matter is that I REALLY DON'T forgive them. There is still resentment that exists because of the damage they have caused, and are still causing to this day. I have to work on my better judgement, and not let this effect my relationships, at least for as long as I have to be with them. I have to learn to grow from it, and not let it **break** me further.

I realized that it's okay to become fractured from attempting to experiencing things. It's fine to be rejected. It's fine to have a piece taken from you. It's fine to experience failures, no matter how severe they might feel. You will still exist, and you will still move forward. If you can't end up making any progress with your efforts, you can at least say you tried. You can at least say that you have learnt something. You will be so much **lighter**. It's not a crutch.

I started crying again.

I have known this before, but it has never hit harder. You will never get anywhere if you don't do anything. You can sit forever long as you like, and make absolutely no progress if you don't do anything. It will never come for you. You will sit there wallowing in self pity and grief of the past, and you will get nowhere if you never give yourself any space to grow. You cannot give yourself space to grow if you don't do anything. You have to do the things you want to do in order to get anywhere in them, and it will feel so cathartic and rewarding when you get there. It will be absolutely wonderful once you get to a place you can feel confident with your existence.

I realized that truly, **I wanted to be loved.** All I want is to be loved and cared for. I want to care for the people that care for me. I want to be able to do things for them as they do things for me. It's all so fucking simple. Obviously I knew this. Obviously all I wanted was this. But really, it feels all so validating. I wasn't losing my mind. I wanted to have so much before, and looked for so many things. But after being so broken up, I just realized I truly just wanted so little. And so little it really is. It's all so validating. I love you HnK.

I realized that I am allowed to be happy. I'm allowed to seek happiness, no matter what awful things I have done, and what awful things other people have told me. No matter how long it takes for me to truly be happy with myself, and not just for others and other things, I know now that I am allowed to feel that way.

I've calmed down again.

There was a point, where I had decided to make a list of my happiest experiences. The initial reason stemmed off of a discussion with my friend, talking about how I was in absolute pure bliss when I was at a specific point in a road trip with a friend. I was thinking about how recent/old my happiest experiences (that I could remember) truly were; however, I was thinking about that list again after reading HnK...

```

I don't really want to post it here because it's too personal for the public. Please take my word on this.
```

A lot of my happiest experiences did not feel like they were experiences that made me feel happy about **myself**. Same with the happiest experience I ever had. There is a nuance to be had here. The experiences **DID** make me feel happy about **WHAT I DID**, but it **DID NOT** make me feel happy about me existing. They didn't feel like they provided value to my existence.

It's so funny, TRULY the only thing that I can think of for myself that provides me value for my existence, is my relationships. My relationships are solely the only thing that provide me any sense of gratitude and happiness for myself. 

This feels so traumatic to experience, but I have learnt so much about myself in such a short period of time, that I have to be grateful and happy for it to exist. I am so thankful that Haruko Ichikawa/市川春子 exists as a person. Just by this work existing, she has become one of the most inspirational people for me. I cannot believe that this truly wasn't a work from a higher being, because
it made me feel so understood
it made me feel so depressed
it made me feel so stressed
it made me feel so validated
it made me feel so speechless
it made me feel so fearful of myself
it made me feel so spiteful of myself
it made me feel so thankful for so much
it made me feel so happy for my agency
it made me feel so hopeful for the future

This is like a religion... I do not condone religion but just let the irony sink in.

Identity is a fuck. Around the same time I decided to read all of the manga, discussions about gender has been popping up a lot in my personal friend group. Houseki no Kuni is notorious--even for people who haven't read it--to touch heavily on the topics of identity.

Gender is a very touchy topic for many reasons.

A lot of cis and trans people would vehemently disagree, and probably get very angry, with my opinions on many aspects of gender, especially because gender matters so much to so many cis and trans people. It's a lot of **stepping on stairs made out of Phosphophyllite...**  It ties in so much with people's identity that the idea of forming an identity devoid of it becomes one that can become aggravating to many. In other words, it's as if forming your identity without a focus on gender becomes an attack on one's identity that is much more focused on gender.

To be fair, it's all really [semantics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T44xBgKV_s)... and aggravation only comes from cases where **we won't learn each other's language.** We must understand each others semantics to truly realize anything for this topic. Anyway...

HnK's rhetoric on gender identity feels like one that is very conflicting for cis and trans people alike. People that have read HnK like to pretend that there isn't endless drivel back and forth on the discussion of how identity is portrayed in the story, but there is... a lot.

> WHY IS THE TL NOT USING X PRONOUNS?
> WHY ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE GEMS AS Y?

That being said, many people easily and willingly ignore it when people use whatever means to refer to the characters. 

I do not... for better or for worse. But it's complicated. In reality, I do not have an issue with **fans** of the series referring to the characters with whatever ways they wish to prefer, but to not translate the characters as nonbinary feels like a **complete disservice**. A crucial point of this entire story is the formation of characters coming to terms with their identity, as well as the formation of their own. **BOTH.** Treating the gems as genderless to me feels like the only right way to go about the entire thing. But... since idpol exists... I do have to disclaim that this could might as well just be me, someone who is a shitty agender freak, just projecting... I guess.

I can't really say I learnt about myself in terms of gender identity from the story, but man is it fucking good at its rhetoric on it. The fact those discussions exist from fans even from as early as 2017... is truly a magnificent feat.

I do have problems with the book... but I don't really care about the problems. It's mainly just pacing and handwaving of stuff I didn't mind handwaved. Volume 12 is basically the sole problem of this. The timeskip ends up handwavy about a bunch of previous things and questions I had, and it glosses over a lot of details I felt were probably not completely trivial(?) I feel like teh volume should probably ahve been 2 volumes or something, and the earlier volumes should've been shorter in its content or something.

Honestly, I do have some degree of issue with how some of the gems progress with their exploration of self and identity as well... but I don't really have fully formed thoughts on this, nor do I really mind it that much because of the many other things this manga has provided me.

<p>Diamond and Euclase especially felt very half baked, and as far as the focus on this aspect of the story... it did make me very sad.</p>

<p>Diamond truly felt like they had no development at all, and for some reason Bort just says Ouuu.... u have changed... yey. Like no, diamond really didn't change much... they got a lot of validation, but nothing really showed their validation transforming them at all honestly</p>

<p>And then Euclase just accepts their situation...? Though really, this might have been affected by the timeskip, becuase that entire part handwaves A LOT.</p>
</details>

Really though, this isn't really much of an issue at all, because while it took me out JUST A LITTLE BIT... it *really* didn't detract any of the experience that mattered to me.
