Wow, I'm actually in Japan.

I'll try updating this everyday for the period I'm here (Apr 1 - Jun 30) (even though I'm starting this April 3). I might also change this to be multiple blog posts instead of just one big one but idk yet...

The day of landing. It was so hectic because I wanted to try getting my pocket wifi at the same day, but I was likely not going to make it.

Immediately, it was interesting how much of a big deal they were making [[MERS]] out to be at the airport customs (I landed at [Narita](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tmUMzkEuivS5cKmX6)), and also their gate of entry was interesting. They had some camera + fingerprint machines that they had randomly select every 4 people out of 50 in the super longass lineup; I think it was meant to try to speed up the process or something? Because it's the same thing you do at the customs desks anyway, but I'm not sure.

When I was flying they made me check-in my carry-on bag because of space or whatever, but I had plates and bowls in that shit so I was kind of concerned they would just have completely broken. Luckily they didn't though everything came intact which was sick.

It was a downpour in Tokyo, and when I checked the weather for Sendai, it was also raining there. It was unfortunate since I had no rain gear or anything. My trip was to take the Narita Express to Tokyo station from Narita, and then take the Shinkansen from Tokyo station to Sendai. The plan was to get an umbrella at Tokyo station once I got to the Shinkansen gate. Unfortunately, once I got to the station, and right by the fucking shinkansen gate, my glass water bottle just Spontaneously exploded and fell to pieces for some fucking reason... So all my buffer time was wasted on standing around the broken pile of glass. This was mostly because the glass was hard to see and they needed to put down pylons to clean the stuff off.

Anyway, I didn't even say what the reason was for me to be in Japan. Basically, I wanted to get into Masters for Biomedical Engineering or the like, and I tried contacting professors from the University of Alberta, but ultimately got no response. So then, I tried contacting other places, and one of them was Tohokudai. Over there, they said I could come over for like a few months to visit the university, and also look at other labs potentially, to see what I'm interested in, and apply then. So basically I'm siphoning my parents money to go there.

I was meeting with 2 of the students from the lab at the station, and it was a good time meeting them. It was still raining like crazy, and everything was just so wet, and my shoes were already getting really soaked, but we went to a Palestinian restaurant ([Zaytoon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JTadyUz8BzbodwKR8)) and got lamb sandwiches, and it was some really good food. I did find it funny that they served a lot of alcohol, but it's not like an issue or anything, just amusing that it was the case there.

By the time I got back home and left the other 2 students, it was too late to get the pocket wifi from the post office, but it was fine because I basically just hit the sack then and there.

Speaking of which, the room is really nice. I didn't understand the heating so I was sleeping in cold for a bit, but it's a really nice size for me. It's also got a laundry machine, and a stove. They also provided a pillow blanket and bed sheet as well.

I forgot that my suitcase was completely tied up, and I had nothing to cut it, so I could only hope that the FamilyMart by the apartment had something to cut... and they did! These convenience stores are honestly kind of amazing you can just get food for like 1 dollar in like 2 minutes. It's like when I'm at home and I want to just eat something I just look at the pantry and cop it. It's actually so nice. You go, get whatever, come back, immediately chilling. No need for bulk buying or anything when you can just go there anytime.

After that I went to Loft... this place is expensive honestly I ended up spending like 12.7k yen there (about 120 dollars) for shit I needed. Also it was still raining like crazy this day, but I was outside for most of it anyway. Also I did get an umbrella from FamilyMart, though by the end of the day my shoes were still completely soaked.

I forgot to mention, but at the Narita station, I ended up getting the Welcome Suica card, instead of an actual Suica card... but it was fine because this day I also got the actual Suica card. In the meantime though I am still using the Welcome Suica card to drain the money from it. I'm also gonna need to figure out how to recharge the money in this card... but that's for later I guess.

After that I went to the Tohokudai Aobayama Campus. This campus of the university is so confusing, but oh my god was it gorgeous. The reason I went there was because I know their Materials Engineering/Science buildings/faculty is located over there, and I wanted to just know where it was to make sure fully. It's possible I may go there sometimes if I get in contact with someone there.

The main picture of this blog post is from there as well! Very nice campus

I realised I ended up buying some things at Loft tax-free, but I was going to use them in Japan... I completely misunderstood what they were trying to tell me so I messed up pretty bad. I guess I really only have to just keep this receipt and then pay like 13 bucks at customs though. I was considering going back to Loft, but I already troubled them a bunch by accidentally purchasing stuff tax-free, and I can only imagine they either can't do anything, or it'd just be even more extra overhead for them to deal with for no reason...

Anyway I got back home, and realised there's an insane smell... it was my shoes and socks...

I had no idea what to do about the shoes, but for the socks, and all the clothes I wore that day, I just put them in the laundry to try to get them cleaned. What I wasn't prepared for however was that this machine was supposedly a washing + drying machine, but the drying function actually doesn't do shit, it's basically just the spin function on a normal washer. So I didn't want the washer to dry some of the clothes because they needed to be hanged. Bad mistake as you'll see, but wow this has been like the most confusing part of the trip so far.

This was my first day at the lab. Started off with a presentation from one of the assistant professors, and then I gradually met most of the people in the lab. Massive lab by the way it spans across 2 floors. They gave me my own desk and a spot in the shoe rack even though I'm like not even actually a student which is cool. One of the PhD students that met me at the station 2 days before also gave me a tour through the entire 2 floors of labs that they use too.

I went with a good lot of them for lunch later at one of the cafeterias, and the food was actually so inexpensive, so I got like 3 small bowls of food and it was good as fuck; also quite filling honestly i was basically stuffed after eating all that.

After that not much really happened at the lab that day, I gave presents to the 2 professors, as well as the secretary that helped me a lot to get to Japan. Talking to some people later I was talking about how my japanese is pretty bad, but even saying `watashiwaomardes` was surprising to people, which was kind of pleasant to see honestly lol.

When I left I went to Loft because I wanted some more pillows, and I wanted hangers, but I couldn't find them selling pillows... AND their hangers were expensive, so I said gg, then I went to COOP to see what the grocery store is like, but ended up only really getting chocolate (and a huge bottle of Pocari Sweat). I'll probably get actual groceries soon though.

Also I had a nanachiki this day, it was so mid bruh whatever man

After that I slowly passed out to sleep.

Oh I forgot about the laundry thing, but yea that morning I woke up to look at the laundry I had running overnight, and apparently the water doesn't get flushed out at all or anything with no drying option selected, and I opened the washer to standing water and completely soaked clothes. So I haphazardly tried to ring out all the water from the clothes, and dried them at the tiny balcony drying rack that there was. They were still completely soaked by night time so I just left them outside. Before I left, I decided to just put my shoes in the washer at like the longest cycle there was which was 3 hours apparently. Those actually got dried after I took them out and put them by the front door overnight. They still smelled, but it was faint, nothing like the insane stench it had before...

Woke up and the clothes were still wet I guess, but its ok since the shoes were dried. Went to the university quite early, only a few people were there at the time. It's quite a chill atmosphere though it doesn't feel like there's any pressure at all that I was expecting when people talk about Japan's work places. It's also a little bit diverse, which probably is part of the reason to be honest.

This was the first day doing actual lab stuff, though I was just shadowing the work. The work basically just consisted of setting up cell stress and cell passaging experiments over the course of like 5-6 hours, going through the whole process of it.

Apparently the lab has a meeting with some company of some sorts, and they be giving the lab free food. They saved a box of lunch for me and it was epic as fuck it was actually so good I was eating like a king randomly.

I still needed some hangers, so after the lab, I decided to try Don Quijote instead of Loft to see if I can find any stuff there instead. What an absolutely absurd experience it is going into that store. Everything wants to grab your entire attention at all times, and its just an insane level of sensory overload. Everything is also very hard to find in that store since everything is just everywhere. SOMEHOW after a while I found packs of 7 hangers for less than 200 yen which is so crazy cheap and made the entire suffering worth it, but still no pillows. Asked someone if they sell any but they took me to the pet pillows so I guessed there wasn't.

Went to a ministop near me and got their chicken. I've been getting chicken from all the convenience stores to see what the hype is about, since everyone talks about the "konbini chicken". Yesterday was the nanachiki and it was mid, and this day was the ministop chicken. This was actually noticeably better, it wasn't like a sloggy slush of chicken this time, and it was nice. I'm shocked this is like 1-2 dollars and just right there at the konbini.

I forgot what happened after, though I do remember trying to figure out what the hell is happening with how to put out trash here. Supposedly for paper you should just tie it all up together and dump it in the garbage container? Which is possibly fine if I had any string I guess... and then for bottles, you are supposed to apparently put them in yellow containers, but I can't find them in convenience stores or near the garbage container, so idk. I did note down the days though at least.

Weekends are the day off! They don't really want the temp/shortterm/visiting people to come in the weekends especially considering not much is happening in the weekends, so I basically took advantage of this.

Supposedly its cherry blossom season, so I decided that it'd probably be a good idea to hit a cherry blossom viewing area. The area I chose was the [Sendai Toshogu Shrine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nsKnVUzriPhSq3cL9) since it would've hit 2 checkboxes of a shrine and the cherry blossoms.

Regrettably... I can't really check off either which I guess I should've expected. The shrine was really cool and I did the praying gestures and all. Something about seeing it in person is much more interesting than online or in media that's definitely for sure; however, I couldn't really tell if I was allowed to go to the back building, and I didn't want to ask if I could because of some paranoia I don't really want to explain right now, so I ended up refraining from seeing all of it.

The cherry blossoms themselves also haven't really blossomed yet, so I guess I decided to do this trip a bit early; though it's weird since I had been constantly hearing that due to global warming, they are blossoming sooner or faster than usual. I guess the news was moreso for the southern part of Japan moreso than the Tohoku region I guess.

Either way it was a great trip. It was so absurd yet amazing taking the train, just going one stop over, and then suddenly it's like I'm in a completely different city. The entire neighbourhood and everything near the shrine looked so insanely different than from near the university campus and the city centre that I was kind of taken aback. The Aobayama campus itself didn't look out of place either because of the amount of really tall buildings on that campus. It was really cool. Definitely considering just taking random trains to random stations honestly.

I decided after, that it was time to try to go to Don Quijote ONCE again. This is because it was possible that there was a communication issue and they thought that since I was on the same floor the animal pillows were, I was looking for those pillows. Unfortunately, they just straight up don't have pillows. It's fine though I bought strawberry and white chocolate pocky to try later. They were decent, the strawberry one tasted better though, and it was also cheaper lol.

Also tried famichiki today for the first time, it was also noticeably much better than the nanachiki, and it was honestly quite good. If I didn't give a shit about how much oil they have, I'd just get this everyday to be honest.

My anki had been insanely flopping lately because I completely neglected it for a good 2-3 days. I open anki and it takes me like almost 2 hours to get through it. I don't even have crazy settings on it's like 20 new cards and 200 review max. Whatever though hopefully I can get back on track to doing Anki everyday.

And before I sleep, I'm just figuring out implementation for attaching pictures to this blog post, and then going to sleep. Also my clothes FINALLY dried, but I'm not fully sure if they smell fine or not. At the very least, the scent they have now is very... Neutral I suppose. I just hope that they don't start smelling like mildew once I wear them.

I'll add pictures after I wake up tomorrow. I added 2 for the first day... hopefully it just... works... and so all I'd have to do tomorrow is pic dump...
