Wow, I'm actually in Japan.

I'll try updating this everyday for the period I'm here (Apr 1 - Jun 30) (even though I'm starting this April 3). I might also change this to be multiple blog posts instead of just one big one but idk yet...

The day of landing. It was so hectic because I wanted to try getting my pocket wifi at the same day, but I was likely not going to make it.

Immediately, it was interesting how much of a big deal they were making [[MERS]] out to be at the airport customs (I landed at [Narita](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tmUMzkEuivS5cKmX6)), and also their gate of entry was interesting. They had some camera + fingerprint machines that they had randomly select every 4 people out of 50 in the super longass lineup; I think it was meant to try to speed up the process or something? Because it's the same thing you do at the customs desks anyway, but I'm not sure.

When I was flying they made me check-in my carry-on bag because of space or whatever, but I had plates and bowls in that shit so I was kind of concerned they would just have completely broken. Luckily they didn't though everything came intact which was sick.

It was a downpour in Tokyo, and when I checked the weather for Sendai, it was also raining there. It was unfortunate since I had no rain gear or anything. My trip was to take the Narita Express to Tokyo station from Narita, and then take the Shinkansen from Tokyo station to Sendai. The plan was to get an umbrella at Tokyo station once I got to the Shinkansen gate. Unfortunately, once I got to the station, and right by the fucking shinkansen gate, my glass water bottle just Spontaneously exploded and fell to pieces for some fucking reason... So all my buffer time was wasted on standing around the broken pile of glass. This was mostly because the glass was hard to see and they needed to put down pylons to clean the stuff off.

Anyway, I didn't even say what the reason was for me to be in Japan. Basically, I wanted to get into Masters for Biomedical Engineering or the like, and I tried contacting professors from the University of Alberta, but ultimately got no response. So then, I tried contacting other places, and one of them was Tohokudai. Over there, they said I could come over for like a few months to visit the university, and also look at other labs potentially, to see what I'm interested in, and apply then. So basically I'm siphoning my parents money to go there.

![sendai station](./sendai1.jpg)

I was meeting with 2 of the students from the lab at the station, and it was a good time meeting them. It was still raining like crazy, and everything was just so wet, and my shoes were already getting really soaked, but we went to a Palestinian restaurant ([Zaytoon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JTadyUz8BzbodwKR8)) and got lamb sandwiches, and it was some really good food. I did find it funny that they served a lot of alcohol, but it's not like an issue or anything, just amusing that it was the case there.

By the time I got back home and left the other 2 students, it was too late to get the pocket wifi from the post office, but it was fine because I basically just hit the sack then and there.

Speaking of which, the room is really nice. I didn't understand the heating so I was sleeping in cold for a bit, but it's a really nice size for me. It's also got a laundry machine, and a stove. They also provided a pillow blanket and bed sheet as well.

I forgot that my suitcase was completely tied up, and I had nothing to cut it, so I could only hope that the FamilyMart by the apartment had something to cut... and they did! These convenience stores are honestly kind of amazing you can just get food for like 1 dollar in like 2 minutes. It's like when I'm at home and I want to just eat something I just look at the pantry and cop it. It's actually so nice. You go, get whatever, come back, immediately chilling. No need for bulk buying or anything when you can just go there anytime.

After that I went to Loft... this place is expensive honestly I ended up spending like 12.7k yen there (about 120 dollars) for shit I needed. Also it was still raining like crazy this day, but I was outside for most of it anyway. Also I did get an umbrella from FamilyMart, though by the end of the day my shoes were still completely soaked.

I forgot to mention, but at the Narita station, I ended up getting the Welcome Suica card, instead of an actual Suica card... but it was fine because this day I also got the actual Suica card. In the meantime though I am still using the Welcome Suica card to drain the money from it. I'm also gonna need to figure out how to recharge the money in this card... but that's for later I guess.

After that I went to the Tohokudai Aobayama Campus. This campus of the university is so confusing, but oh my god was it gorgeous. The reason I went there was because I know their Materials Engineering/Science buildings/faculty is located over there, and I wanted to just know where it was to make sure fully. It's possible I may go there sometimes if I get in contact with someone there.

The main picture of this blog post is from there as well! Very nice campus

![walk through the arterial rode of Tohokudai Aobayama Campus](./sendai3.jpg)![Aobayama Campus Garden](./sendai4.jpg)

I realised I ended up buying some things at Loft tax-free, but I was going to use them in Japan... I completely misunderstood what they were trying to tell me so I messed up pretty bad. I guess I really only have to just keep this receipt and then pay like 13 bucks at customs though. I was considering going back to Loft, but I already troubled them a bunch by accidentally purchasing stuff tax-free, and I can only imagine they either can't do anything, or it'd just be even more extra overhead for them to deal with for no reason...

Anyway I got back home, and realised there's an insane smell... it was my shoes and socks...

I had no idea what to do about the shoes, but for the socks, and all the clothes I wore that day, I just put them in the laundry to try to get them cleaned. What I wasn't prepared for however was that this machine was supposedly a washing + drying machine, but the drying function actually doesn't do shit, it's basically just the spin function on a normal washer. So I didn't want the washer to dry some of the clothes because they needed to be hanged. Bad mistake as you'll see, but wow this has been like the most confusing part of the trip so far.

![Right before leaving with gifts to professors and secretaries](./sendai5.jpg)

This was my first day at the lab. Started off with a presentation from one of the assistant professors, and then I gradually met most of the people in the lab. Massive lab by the way it spans across 2 floors. They gave me my own desk and a spot in the shoe rack even though I'm like not even actually a student which is cool. One of the PhD students that met me at the station 2 days before also gave me a tour through the entire 2 floors of labs that they use too.

I went with a good lot of them for lunch later at one of the cafeterias, and the food was actually so inexpensive, so I got like 3 small bowls of food and it was good as fuck; also quite filling honestly i was basically stuffed after eating all that.

After that not much really happened at the lab that day, I gave presents to the 2 professors, as well as the secretary that helped me a lot to get to Japan. Talking to some people later I was talking about how my japanese is pretty bad, but even saying `watashiwaomardes` was surprising to people, which was kind of pleasant to see honestly lol.

When I left I went to Loft because I wanted some more pillows, and I wanted hangers, but I couldn't find them selling pillows... AND their hangers were expensive, so I said gg, then I went to COOP to see what the grocery store is like, but ended up only really getting chocolate (and a huge bottle of Pocari Sweat). I'll probably get actual groceries soon though.

Also I had a nanachiki this day, it was so mid bruh whatever man

![Pocari Sweat x Nanachiki](./sendai6.jpg)

After that I slowly passed out to sleep.

Oh I forgot about the laundry thing, but yea that morning I woke up to look at the laundry I had running overnight, and apparently the water doesn't get flushed out at all or anything with no drying option selected, and I opened the washer to standing water and completely soaked clothes. So I haphazardly tried to ring out all the water from the clothes, and dried them at the tiny balcony drying rack that there was. They were still completely soaked by night time so I just left them outside. Before I left, I decided to just put my shoes in the washer at like the longest cycle there was which was 3 hours apparently. Those actually got dried after I took them out and put them by the front door overnight. They still smelled, but it was faint, nothing like the insane stench it had before...

# April 4 2025 JST
*Written at April 5 11:25 UTC*

Woke up and the clothes were still wet I guess, but its ok since the shoes were dried. Went to the university quite early, only a few people were there at the time. It's quite a chill atmosphere though it doesn't feel like there's any pressure at all that I was expecting when people talk about Japan's work places. It's also a little bit diverse, which probably is part of the reason to be honest.

This was the first day doing actual lab stuff, though I was just shadowing the work. The work basically just consisted of setting up cell stress and cell passaging experiments over the course of like 5-6 hours, going through the whole process of it.

Apparently the lab has a meeting with some company of some sorts, and they be giving the lab free food. They saved a box of lunch for me and it was epic as fuck it was actually so good I was eating like a king randomly.

![Beautiful lunch box](./sendai7.jpg)

I still needed some hangers, so after the lab, I decided to try Don Quijote instead of Loft to see if I can find any stuff there instead. What an absolutely absurd experience it is going into that store. Everything wants to grab your entire attention at all times, and its just an insane level of sensory overload. Everything is also very hard to find in that store since everything is just everywhere. SOMEHOW after a while I found packs of 7 hangers for less than 200 yen which is so crazy cheap and made the entire suffering worth it, but still no pillows. Asked someone if they sell any but they took me to the pet pillows so I guessed there wasn't.

![Hell (Don Quijote)](./sendai8.jpg)

Went to a ministop near me and got their chicken. I've been getting chicken from all the convenience stores to see what the hype is about, since everyone talks about the "konbini chicken". Yesterday was the nanachiki and it was mid, and this day was the ministop chicken. This was actually noticeably better, it wasn't like a sloggy slush of chicken this time, and it was nice. I'm shocked this is like 1-2 dollars and just right there at the konbini.

I forgot what happened after, though I do remember trying to figure out what the hell is happening with how to put out trash here. Supposedly for paper you should just tie it all up together and dump it in the garbage container? Which is possibly fine if I had any string I guess... and then for bottles, you are supposed to apparently put them in yellow containers, but I can't find them in convenience stores or near the garbage container, so idk. I did note down the days though at least.

# April 5 2025 JST
*Written at April 5 12:40 UTC*

Weekends are the day off! They don't really want the temp/shortterm/visiting people to come in the weekends especially considering not much is happening in the weekends, so I basically took advantage of this.

Supposedly its cherry blossom season, so I decided that it'd probably be a good idea to hit a cherry blossom viewing area. The area I chose was the [Sendai Toshogu Shrine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nsKnVUzriPhSq3cL9) since it would've hit 2 checkboxes of a shrine and the cherry blossoms.

Regrettably... I can't really check off either which I guess I should've expected. The shrine was really cool and I did the praying gestures and all. Something about seeing it in person is much more interesting than online or in media that's definitely for sure; however, I couldn't really tell if I was allowed to go to the back building, and I didn't want to ask if I could because of some paranoia I don't really want to explain right now, so I ended up refraining from seeing all of it.

The cherry blossoms themselves also haven't really blossomed yet, so I guess I decided to do this trip a bit early; though it's weird since I had been constantly hearing that due to global warming, they are blossoming sooner or faster than usual. I guess the news was moreso for the southern part of Japan moreso than the Tohoku region I guess.

![Toshogu Shrine 1](./sendai9.jpg)![Toshogu Shrine 2](./sendai10.jpg)![Toshogu Shrine 3](./sendai11.jpg)![Toshogu Shrine 4](./sendai12.jpg)![Toshogu Shrine 5](./sendai13.jpg)![Toshogu Shrine 6](./sendai14.jpg)

Either way it was a great trip. It was so absurd yet amazing taking the train, just going one stop over, and then suddenly it's like I'm in a completely different city. The entire neighbourhood and everything near the shrine looked so insanely different than from near the university campus and the city centre that I was kind of taken aback. The Aobayama campus itself didn't look out of place either because of the amount of really tall buildings on that campus. It was really cool. Definitely considering just taking random trains to random stations honestly.

![Toshogu neighbourhood](./sendai15.jpg)

I decided after, that it was time to try to go to Don Quijote ONCE again. This is because it was possible that there was a communication issue and they thought that since I was on the same floor the animal pillows were, I was looking for those pillows. Unfortunately, they just straight up don't have pillows. It's fine though I bought strawberry and white chocolate pocky to try later. They were decent, the strawberry one tasted better though, and it was also cheaper lol.

Also tried famichiki today for the first time, it was also noticeably much better than the nanachiki, and it was honestly quite good. If I didn't give a shit about how much oil they have, I'd just get this everyday to be honest.

My anki had been insanely flopping lately because I completely neglected it for a good 2-3 days. I open anki and it takes me like almost 2 hours to get through it. I don't even have crazy settings on it's like 20 new cards and 200 review max. Whatever though hopefully I can get back on track to doing Anki everyday.

And before I sleep, I'm just figuring out implementation for attaching pictures to this blog post, and then going to sleep. Also my clothes FINALLY dried, but I'm not fully sure if they smell fine or not. At the very least, the scent they have now is very... Neutral I suppose. I just hope that they don't start smelling like mildew once I wear them.

I'll add pictures after I wake up tomorrow. I added 2 for the first day... hopefully it just... works... and so all I'd have to do tomorrow is pic dump...

For some reason my Obsidian isn't expanding its window on my laptop. It's running NixOS, which... comes with its upsides and downsides, but I do enjoy using it so far.

Today was mostly just home improvement more than anything though. I still wanted pillows, and started looking at Amazon, but it was honestly relatively quite expensive looking at it.

Finally, a friend of mine though suggested to get it from Nitori, and so I went there, and not only did i IMMEDIATELY find pillows, I also found clothing hangers cheaper than in Donki, 10 hangers vs 7 for the same price. Crazy

After that I was finally able to put my suitcases to the side instead of having them filled with clothes, and get a bit more space in my room that was being taken up by my massive suitcase.

I still didn't eat at all today and I was thinking of starting to cook for myself, so I went to COOP and got some groceries. Took a bit, but I found pretty much everything I was trying to look for I think. Rice, meat, spices, egg, milk, coffee, sugar, bananas. Also got myself a 280 yen meal to eat today which was nice. I did forget oil though, but oh well..

I'm shocked that the milk here is actually just so much better than in North America. I took a sip of coffee and it immediately hit. I was like WHAT the hell??? The milk is so fucking good? and I got the cheapest milk there was in COOP. Absolutely mindblowing honestly.

Unfortunately I wasted a decent amount of my day fooling around online, so I ended up not having much time to add more pictures to this. Hopefully I get to it like this week or so.

# April 7 2025 JST
*Written at April 7 12:32 UTC*

Still had no time to add more pictures today, maybe tomorrow or the day after or the day after...

Lots of interesting stuff at the lab today. Saw someone do surgery on a rat with close-up gore. It was honestly very interesting though of how stroke models were being set up with genetic changes and all.

I also had ramen in Japan for the first time. I got some really mid ass ramen though from the faculty cafeteria for 5 bux, but honestly it compares similarly to the fuckass 20 dollar ramen u get in Canada so...

After that it was some more cell bio lab technique stuff, specifically PCR and E.Coli culturing. During that time I heard from one of the PhD students that Sendai is known for beef tongue, and for Zundamon, and that I should try the Zunda shake. Honestly I didn't even know that [Zundamon](https://voisona.com/song/artist/zundamon_ja_JP/)'s character design was based on Edamame, so that was an interesting revelation...

Afterwards I went back home, copped a Zunda shake for 380 yen, and a Lawson chiki. Lawson chiki was as good as famichiki, but yea that's the end of the chiki saga I'm not having any more in Japan lol. Zunda shake though.................. that was probably the best thing I've tasted here so far. Holy shit it was so fukcing good i want more even though it was kinda expensive at like 3-4 dollars for a small cup.

I was actually in the lab so long that it's almost 10 pm and I still haven't finished my Anki... oh well it probably won't be for as long tomorrow or the day after(?) There's new students coming this week though so idk, gonna have to see

# April 8 2025 JST
*Written at April 8 23:37 UTC*

Nothing super exciting really happened; today I met the prof again in the lab meeting and also discussed about how I do programming with him and an assistant professor later, and then watched some more PCR experimental process stuff. Was going to watch someone else do something as well, but they had to leave to do clinic work early.

I tried the [hagi no tsuki](https://www.sanzen.co.jp/english/haginotsuki/index.html) though. It was chill, not amazing but yea. Zunda shake still at top rn. Honestly though it was like 260(?) yen for one, and it was really expensive for what it was worth tbh, the zunda shake was worth its price much more in comparison.

![Hagi no Tsuki](./sendai17.jpg)

Tried to do more anki when I got home but instead I watched ishowspeed china vods and then passed out lol. Was going to get more home appliances stuff but it was gonna start raining by the time I'd have been done so I just went home instead. I'm writing this the day after's morning if you can't tell lol

# April 9 2025 JST
*Written at April 9 12:43 UTC*

Reallyyy busy day today I didn't get home until 8 pm. Trying to remember what happened first off... ah watched more E.Coli culturing, and then talked about PCR results analysis, and then watched some insane process of the [[Northern Blot]]. I remember doing Western Blot in a biology class a few years ago, but my memory is barely there for that; watching northern blotting was kind of insane... also saw the production of Agar feed for E.Coli.

By that time it was around like 5 pm and people were heading out for dinner and invited me. One of them paid for my ramen which was REALLY epic of them, because I put a 10k yen bill into my Suica lol so I basically have no cash left.

The place we went to was a fish ramen shop, which was really interesting. It was also technically my first Official ramen because the ramen in the cafeteria for 5 bux doesn't really count. Anyway this fish ramen was fuckin epic it was way better than the ramen at the cafeteria. Actually surprising how good it tasted considering it's fish in ramen, a combination I didn't expect to work so well.

![Ramen Shop Shelf](./sendai18.jpg) ![Ramen Shop Item Selector](./sendai19.jpg) ![Yummy ramen food](./sendai20.jpg)

The city layout and planning in Japan is just so different, like you see how different it is online already, but when you're there in person it's really interesting how everything is laid out/side by side when you walk down streets of various sizes. Getting to the ramen shop you go down a decently-sized street in Sendai's standards, and even that is nothing like you would see in North America at all. It's so fascinating something so simple and fundamental and basic in Sendai is just nonexistent in North America. Man Canada fucking sucks.

This was also the first time I rode the bus in Sendai. I might just ride the bus from now on instead of the subway because it's not only cheaper (190 yen to 210 yen), it also takes less time, because most of the walking I do between the station and the university is covered by the bus. The bus ride itself was just a normal ass bus ride nothing crazy. Though it was interesting how you always have to leave from the front of the bus because of how payment works for them.

![Sendai roads are so fucking chill](./sendai21.jpg)

Also got myself bag clips for once, so I can finally cook some rice for myself, maybe for breakfast tomorrow if I wake up early enough, but we'll see.

I also started working on the comments section for my site, and will probably change the sort ordering for pages by last updated instead of created. Maybe both will be done tomorrow. Maybe I'll also finally add pictures to this blog post tomorrow too. We'll see. Tomorrow I'm with the lab until like 7-8 pm so who knows.

# April 10 2025 JST
*Written at April 10 23:24 UTC*

What a hectic day. New student came in to the lab this day. He's from France and he does look very french; that in itself was quite exciting honestly. After that it was a bunch more lab stuff, did some cell passaging and made my own cell culture plate for [[HEK]] cells, and then I also watched the final process of the [[Northern Blot]] which is such a long process honestly and it seems difficulty to deal with the gel and stuff. After that was further [[Ribonucleic Acid]] extraction from E.Coli cells.

Ah before the lab, I had a meeting with professors back at the University of Alberta, hoping to see how that goes. Ideally, I can get into a sort of double masters thing where I can do a masters at both Tohokudai and UofA, but I don't really know yet. Next week is going to be very stressful to try to figure all of this out.

Ate lunch at the university cafeteria this day, and got a nice bowl of rice and crispy fried fish, and it was like a total of like 250 yen or something. It's kind of crazy how even the most basic of foods tastes so much better than in Canada for so much cheaper man I don't understand how Canada flops like this.

I'm also running out of money; luckily a friend of mine found some bank spots and stuff that can convert usd to yen, so i gotta do that [april 11](#april-11-2025-jst), i also want a zunda shake again SO BAD its fucking gkilling me man

That evening was the "hanami" but there wasn't really any cherry blossom viewing happening. So basically the entire neurosurgery departments of Sendai rented out an all you can eat yakiniku spot across the city, and there were like hundreds of people there it was crazy. Ironically almost no foreigners though and the foreigners were like in their own little corner lol. It's not like it really mattered that much just amusing. 

Anyway the food there was probably some of the best food I ever had. What the fuck. Someone ordered a pizza at the yakiniku LOL but it was like the second best pizza I ever had???? At a yakiniku???????? Like what the fuck. Also the meat was so fucking good, the fries were so fucking good, the kimchi was epic, the almond jelly was fucking amazinf. I can't believe it. And it was free because all the neurosurgeons basically paid for the meal lololol

![Yakiniku food](./sendai22.jpg)

We DID take an entire massive group picture by the cherry blossom trees after the food, but it was night so it's not the greatest picture. It was really pretty though multiple layers of cherry blossom branches on top of another, and the trees were also lined up side by side as well. Really gorgeous sight honestly.

![Shifuku](./sendai23.jpg)

Some point after someone asked me about if I have a girlfriend in Canada, and then it later on devolved towards the idea of "You should get a girlfriend here in Japan" and "Are you thinking of dating/Why don't you wanna date?" And Honestly at the moment it wasn't that bad, I just said it's complicated over and over until they stopped picking on it, but it's been kind of rotting my brain.

The inherent issue is like, how do I truly discern if I can talk about gender and sexuality at a given space? Even in Edmonton/Alberta/Canada it's kind of impossible/inscrutable to discern this usually, and it's not like it's any easier in Sendai lol. Like I'm not even sure if I'm asexual or pansexual or even like women or men or anything else for that matter, but I can't really talk about that because it's never clear if it's safe to talk about stuff like that or not. 

Even if I were to try dating women in Japan, I'm not really sure if I could handle the cultural differences truly? If I were to date someone it'd probably be someone who doesn't really give a shit about gender, but I am PRETTY sure gender identity is very strictly adhered to by people here, at least the cis people here.

Ok I don't really want to ramble about this brainrot because it's just really drunk people asking me about stuff because they are really drunk, so I'll just end that there. I got home at like around 10 pm? While I was going to the station from the university, I also saw my professor behind me when I turned to go into a 7/11, and he had a massive smile and waved back at me. He's so epic

Hopefully I get pictures up soon. Comments should be up [April 11](#april-11-2025-jst) though.

# April 11 2025 JST
*Written at April 13 2:01 UTC*

Comments DID go up this day let me tell you. They did in fact go up. I'm actually really happy about it even though at the time of writing there hasn't been new comments lolol. Hopefully I also get table of contents up for pages like these as well for easier nav.... and also the pictures...

Not much actually happened this day I believe. The majority of the lab was basically knocked out I think from the night before because noone was there. I left a bit early as a result since there wasn't really much to do this day. I wanted to ask about a project the professor was talking about on the bus as we were going to the dinner, but he wasn't there either.

![Cute little entrance](./sendai24.jpg)

I also converted the USD i actually brought now finally, honestly the fact I was able to survive for a week off of like just 150 CAD is pretty impressive in my opinion. Like I had to get home appliances and stuff too, and I still ate out, and it still all fit in 150 CAD the past like 9 or so days. Anyway I lost 10 dollars apparently because the USD JPY was like 143 JPY per dollar? and I exchanged at 140. Oh well

After that I think I basically did nothing. I finally got on discord VC for once after so long. Back home I'd always be on discord VC like basically every waking moment, so it's kind of crazy how little I was on discord VC since until now. Since my laptop is running NixOS and it's honestly like my first time using a Linux OS that isn't just like a server or like WSL or something, it was a bit of a hassle. The audio drivers still bug out for some reason, which I'm not sure why, but it's manageable so far.

Proton works really well too, I'm kind of shocked. I just turned on the steam play toggle thing and I was immediately able to just play Neon White. Weirdly though, the mouse feels like its polling rate is really low for some reason? It's the same mouse I used at home, so I think it's just something with the drivers of this computer currently, but that's an investigation for another time.

*Written at April 13 2:29 UTC*

This morning was hell. The night of [April 10](#april-10-2025-jst) was brainrotting me like crazy. Something about it was just bothering me so much but I couldn't really figure out why. The whole thing of being asked if I have a GF and that I should get one and that I should go to Osaka and whatever the fuck. Like it's not really the issue of them saying all that, but the issue of me not being sure if I'm allowed to respond how I want to when that shit is brought up.

Also I have to contemplate a lot about what to do for Masters. I didn't bring it up for the [April 11](#april-11-2025-jst) day, but basically they said they are chill for me to come as a Mechanical Engineering masters student to their lab September or January; however, I asked them if a double degree situation would be possible, where I would be able to do a dual masters program between Tohoku University and the University of Alberta, and they said the administrative work is not feasible at the current time. Which I get, but it's also very unfortunate and annoying that this is the situation now...

I REALLY do not want to be stuck in Edmonton for so much longer, and the lab at Tohokudai is so fuckin chill (so far), but the degree at U of A would be really beneficial. I am considering basically 3 options now:
1. I'm just fucked and I just do the masters at UofA and stay stuck there for more years I guess
2. Suggest if I can just do the paperwork for them or something maybe
3. Do 2 simultaneous disconnected Masters at the same time.
In order of preference, I guess it's just 2 > 3 >= 1. 3 sounds like an insane hassle to try to manage. If they let me do 2 then that would be really nice. 1 would be so fucking sad, but maybe I could just do PhD at Tohokudai after? But if I get offered in U of A again, I'd end up having to take that instead.

Whatever, anyway I went out for a long time this day. I was craving some eel, but before that I also needed to get cream, so I went window shopping for a long time. They have SO MUCH lotion here, but no cream... in the end I went to hell (Don Quijote) and I found some moisturising gel, which sounded quite interesting. I found out it's like even lighter than lotion later though, but honestly considering my skin is not really that oily or dry, I figured I should try it. The reason I used cream before was because it lasted super long, but it wasn't like much better than lotion in the first place for me.

After that, I ate at an Izakaya that specialised in eel dishes. I got 2 dishes, a Garlic Harami Bowl, and an Unaju Take. The reason I got 2 dishes was because I failed like crazy getting the Garlic Harami Bowl because I thought it was an eel dish but it was steak... and I'm eating at an eel place... and I'm craving eel... so I HAD to get the Unaju Take. It was kind of a mistake because I was already full by the Garlic Harami Bowl, but I had to get some fucking eel man. The Garlic Harami Bowl was 1980 yen, and the Unaju Take bowl was 1990 yen; both were on the bit of the pricey side, but they were some really bougie dishes I can't lie, and they tasted fucking amazing so like I honestly don't care they could've charged me like 25 bux for each instead really.

![Garlic Harami Don](./sendai25.jpg) ![Unaju Take](./sendai26.jpg)

I did some more window shopping but ultimately didn't really get anything, and then just went back home. I have been slacking like crazy on Anki, so I was thinking of doing some of that, but I just passed out for like 2-3 hours apparently. Woke up and forgot that I have to finish some food that's in my fridge because the best before dates were coming up on them...... so I had to eat EVEN more lol, but it's ok.

A friend gave me a [[Made in Abyss]] mug for my last birthday, and I found out that since I'm in Japan, I could go to the store he got it from, the name of which is Cospa. It was apparently in the building I went to at some point while window shopping, so I'm going to go again [April 13](#april-13-2025-jst) to check out what they got.

Tried writing a Statement of Purpose but failed finishing it last night, so I'm gonna have to do that [April 13](#april-13-2025-jst) as well. Oh well, hopefully though I catch up on Anki and get pictures up on this page soon.

Today I did the household choress as in I kind of barely cleaned my room, and cleaned the kitchen area. After that I went to the building. The building itself was called [EBeanS](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2m2PPFMrdMansVYq8) and it was about like 11 floors of mostly otaku shit, which was kinda epic.

![Horny ass anime figures](./sendai27.jpg) ![Interesting... dolls](./sendai28.jpg) ![Crazy shounen jump mag it's so thick](./sendai29.jpg) ![Insane but epic layout of things in this store](./sendai30.jpg) ![Galaxy Express 999](./sendai31.jpg) ![Made in Abyss the GOAT](./sendai32.jpg) ![Dumbass yuri manga](./sendai33.jpg) ![Frieren](./sendai34.jpg) ![Nanachi Fishing Shirt](./sendai35.jpg) ![Funny ass playstation game merch](./sendai36.jpg)

The biggest highlight for sure though, was finding the last volume of [[Houseki no Kuni]]. If you've seen the [[They is me]] blog post, then you'd probably know how much I love this series. I got both versions because I obviously had to: the normal edition because the cover is ABSOLUTELY gorgeous and pretty, and the special edition, which also has a very beautiful cover, but it's not the same as the normal edition one, it's still a fucking insanely epic cover though. The special edition also came with a massive book of poems which I obviously cannot read at all, but hopefully I can sooner or later. I wanted to find some HnK merch as well... but unfortunately I couldn't find much.

Today was the first time I ate a Monaka ice cream wafer sandwich. It was really good honestly. Man japanese food is just so much better for no reason it's crazy even the random sweets in the fuckin convenience store is so much better... still not as good as a Zunda shake obv but still amazing. 

I also "caught up" on Anki today. 2 hours total of going through shitty cards man. Also I have caught up on quotations because with how Anki works, almost all of them are just going to be reiterated [April 14](#april-14-2025-jst), so it's gonna be a bit before I'm like actually "caught up" and don't have hundreds of reviews to deal with lol

It was raining but I still hung clothes out outside because idgaf, regretting it though because it started raining pretty hard. Oh well

Finally got pictures up on this blog post!!!! So many pictures!!!! Can't wait to add more!!!

Today I woke up SO late, somehow I was really tired last night I guess I slept a good like 8 hours or so. I was still falling asleep though at the lab somehow I don't really know how or why...

Some stuff has happened in the lab though which was cool; discussing a project with one of the new students about [[Astrocyte]]s and the lab's use of them for [[Moyamoya Disease]] research, and how a cell line is kind of faulty currently, so the research is to find a possibly better alternative to it.

Alongside that I talked with the professor about a project he had in mind to give me. It has a lot to do with [[Ribonucleic Acid Splicing]] and modelling predictions on gene expressions with splicing results. Basically between these 2 projects I now got a LOT of work to do lolol

After the lab I went to Matsuya. I was told this is like the fast food of Japan, so my expectations were at that level. Let me tell you though in terms of fast food, this was EASILY S tier blowing literally any NA fast food chain out of the fucking water man. First of all it's ACTUALLY fast food, the food gets out in like 10 minutes to you which is crazy. Second of all, the food itself is like miles better than the slop you get from McDonalds and shit. I actually can't believe it. If I would be able to pay for a smaller sizing, this would be an insanely crazy place to go often because it's just insane as a fast food place. The sizing I got was way too much for me lol. The miso soup was definitely some miso soup. Nothing crazy obviously. The eel shop I went to obviously had better soup lol

![Matsuya Food](./sendai46.jpg)

Thank god I got pictures up on this blog post LOL can't wait to keep adding them

Projectss projects projects. Projects have finally started for me in the lab which is kind of exciting. One is a bioinformatics project the prof has pitched to me. The other is finding an alternative control cell line for glial cells to observe moyamoya disease. I think I already talked about these actually but yea

There's an "event corner" in the actual hospital itself, and today they were selling Zunda Mochis and Dangos there which was sick. Uhhhh but I didn't get any of the Zunda food there though lol I took a set of 3 variety Dangos. One was walnut, one was red bean, and one was seasame soy sauce. They were all decent, but the walnut one was the only one I'd probably have again willingly, that one was really good. I kind of regret not trying the Zunda Dangos now though lol but they'll be back in like a week

Nothing much else really happened this day. No updates from U of A, and I basically just went to the COOP grocery store after the lab and went home.  I did get Mitarashi Dangos from the COOP store though and those were firee, not as good as walnut IMO.... IMO..... but they were pretty fire. Also had takoyaki and they were good, but they really made me want to try restaurant takoyaki now lol

Progresss on projects is happening. Learning a lot about bioinformatics for genes and RNa sequences. Also a lot of cell culturing stuff. Not much else about the lab itself rn aside for just grinding. I did feel like a combination of being really hyperactive alongside being really locked in on the work I was doing somehow. It was like it felt really apparent I was getting really locked in in a way that I never really felt before. Not really sure why tho

I got acceptance for the University of Alberta's Course-based masters for Biomedical Engineering... Currently that's like prio # 3 now though. Prio # 1 is the masters program here at Tohoku, and then prio # 2 is the thesis-based masters in Mechanical Engineering at U of A, cuz it's thesis based and not course based, but yea it's like hmmmmm that's nice I guess. I have to respond by like May 6 though but there's an option to defer it so I'll probably do that

After the lab I went to a cafe I wanted to go to becuase it looked interesting. It's called [MILLS](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D47KeC7L9NPJoWrp6) The picture was making me expect that the front of the shop looks like that, but it doesn't. That picture itself was like 4-5 years old. The new location is in a basement actually, but the vibe is pretty much the same as that picture though honestly. 

![Cafe au lait](./sendai49.jpg)

It was completely empty, there was noone else there aside for me, the barista who was just chillin, and one other person who left shortly after I came in. I ordered a hot cafe au lait and nothing else, and basically was just chilling there for an hour looking at stuff and talked a really tiny bit to the barista. Honestly it was sick as fuck how chill it is I'm gonna go again Friday.

![MILLS 1](./sendai50.jpg) 
![MILLS 2](./sendai51.jpg)

After that I just copped some COOP food, chicken skewers, and then went to sleep pretty much lol

# April 17 2025 JST
*Written at April 17 16:18 UTC*

Exhausting day at the lab even though I wasn't really doing anything. Really all I was doing today was just constantly researching and learning about [[Ribonucleic Acid Sequencing]] and everything that leads to rMATS to then start on the actual project later, but it feels like I'm not progressing a lot on it, and that it's too slow as a result. It's fine though I think.

I guess tomorrow (friday) I won't be going though because I was notified that the fire inspectors for the apartment may need access to my room during their inspection which is from 10:00 to 16:30. LONG ass time period I won't lie... but it's chill I'll just be in my room I guess

Went to a ramen shop near my house called [Yokoyokoya Sendai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YJYJUvw2sqRma8fg9). Somehow, like the cafe, there was basically noone there. There was basically a group of 2 people (talking in english too), and the ramen cook, and that's pretty much it. Kinda epic as fuck though that I'm just going to these shops with noone in them and just chilling.

![Ramen restaurant](./sendai52.jpg) ![Tonkotsu Ramen](./sendai53.jpg)

Anyway I basically only ordered the basic ramen option they had in the vending machine thing they have in ramen shops and gave it to the cook, and got the ramen pretty quick honestly. It's like just a basic tonkotsu ramen. It was really fucking good though I honestly drank the whole broth.

Also bought a weighing machine today from Nitori. Found out I've lost like a total of 10 pounds (4.5 kgs) since the start of this month holy fuck. Japan be making me lose that shit fast which is kinda nice, but I was already losing weight since last September so it's honestly kind of scary lol

Nothing else really happened today. I did go to FamilyMart at midnight, and was kind of shocked for some reason that the streets were just dead empty. Like noone was there, no cars were out moving AT ALL, dead silence in the middle of the city. Kind of mind blowing in a way it was cool.

Not going to the lab tomorrow so I've just been up lol, hopefully I can basically feel like I've grasped a very deep dive level of knowledge for all the content I need to understand before I can start doing the research work, because that is honestly quite exciting for me.

# April 18 2025 JST
*Written at April 19 10:26 UTC*

Fire inspection today. I was planning to stay home all day and not go to the lab, but they ended up inspecting my room at like 10:00 instead of 16:00 (JST) so I was like whatever fuck it I'll go to the lab today too.

You know, I forgot to mention that on [April 17](#april-17-2025-jst) was the main professor's birthday. It was kinda sick as fuck one of the students gave him a Rubik's Cube and he was destroying that shit it was crazy. Also little known secret of mine but I really don't like cake, but the cake they had there was actually so fucking nice I'm not gonna lie it wasn't nauseatingly sweet it was good as fuck.

Anyway when I went to the lab today I got a lot of clarification about one of the project's that I've started working on, discussing with an assistant professor as well as the main professor about it, and further intricacies. So over the weekend and next week I have a pretty good idea on where to go now.

Nothing else really happened, I got a Zunda shake (peak drink), COOP food, and then I actually tried ice cream at a Mini Stop. They say Mini Stop got the best ice cream or some shit. I got a matcha ice cream in a cone, and they give u a spoon u can eat too with it. The ice cream was just fine thuogh honestly it wasn't worth like the 350 yen or whatever that it cost...

*Written at April 19 10:56 UTC*

Today was a sitting inside day. I was contemplating as to whether I would make this day a going to random station and walking around day, or staying at home day, and the latter won. I had """promised""" friends that I would watch stuff they suggested.

First series I watched was [Shadowstone Park](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI6HmVcz0NXoK8w682PPy2g-kr8apXhne) which is made by the same person who made Charlie the Unicorn. Good 1.5 hour watch straight on youtube if you're interested. Dialogue is very very tightly packed, and the lore and consequences in the story are quite interesting.

Second series I watched was [Sparkle on Raven](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuSEX5dm72SFhpVyM7Bqm456A3XnVrHKu) which is made by SOMEONE idk who the channel is owned by really. Anyway it was also good it's not really about anything it's moreso just focused on maximizing parody and got some good jokes using/focused on  animation/audio/tropes.

After that I was basically just doing nothing. I did Anki in the morning so I was chilling. I went to a ramen shop again today though, and it was probably the best ramen I've had so far honestly. The broth wasn't like just full of oil and shit so it was great to finish up.

![Goated ramen](./sendai54.jpg)

Andd at the end of the day I'm basically just writing yesterday's and this day's blog posts, and then potentially doing something for research projects or something else. I do want to make some music and work on creative stuff though man but I haven't gotten any time lately

# April 20 2025 JST
*Written at April 20 13:51 UTC*

This day was kind of an entire blur. I cooked for myself today and the rice actually came out nice this time. The ingredients in Japan are honestly better than in Canada or something man it actually tastes so much better somehow. Like I just made myself egg and rice and it was so fucking good.

I really don't remember what else I did today aside for that, study for some projects (A TINY BIT, GETTING DISTRACTED THE REST OF TEH TIME) and getting some snacks from FamilyMart. I wanted to go to the cafe today and maybe hop off some random JR station and walk around, but I was like I should really just study for my projects... Here we are now

# April 21 2025 JST
*Written at April 23 01:05 UTC*

Chillin, mostly researched more on the projects I was working on, and it's beeen chill. I'm working with the new french guy for one of them basically, and for the other one I'm doing it myself, but the one I'm doing myself is all just on the computer so it's chill tbh.

I basically just ate the same rice and egg I made myself in the morning. It's so good for no reason man. Ah in the evening I had Matsuya's beef bowl, and it was like 500-600 yen or something, but it was so fucking good like I can't believe this is Japan's level of fast food and in NA it's just shite. They do have shit like McDonalds and stuff obviously but like they aren't "originated from Japan" like how they are "originated from NA".

Also went to hell (Don Quijote) again, and bought stuff. My toothbrush started to just comlpetely break apart into pieces so I had to buy a new one for like 30 bux and it was better than my old toothbrush lol. I also bought lotion because the gel honestly wasn't really moisturizing enough, so I was like whatever let me try buying lotion. Turns out the lotion is so fucking thin too it's LITEARLLY LIKE JUST WATER. It's nothing like Aveeno's products so I'm just stumped honestly don't know what I'd do next. The lotion IS pretty nice though I put it on in the shower after patting myself dry a bit.

Nothing much else happened that day. I bought this bag that had chunks of weird caramel-like candy and it was fucking awful but it was less than a dollar so whatever; i'm definitely not finishing this shit though so idk

# April 22 2025 JST
*Written at April 23 01:32 UTC*

Meeting with the professor, I got the data so it's time to go to town with it for research lol. Still learning and figuring out how [[Percent Spliced In]] works though, but it will come soon.

Presentation is also almost done; I don't remember if I mentioned this but we are presenting this Thursday for the project lol. It's kinda chill though it doesn't really feel like I have a ton of expectations being laid down on me for the presentation you know, so I feel like it'll be fine regardless of what happens.

Also got a ton more Zunda food because the stall from last tuesday was back up at the hospital. I bought Zunda Dango + Walnut Dango, and Zunda Mochi. Honestly the walnut dangos are better than the zunda dongos, they are probably my favourite kind of dango loll. Both were really good though, same with the mochi too that was nice as hell.

![Walnut + Zunda Dangos](./sendai55.jpg)

Ate some ramen later too from the ramen restaurant I went to myself on [April 17](#april-17-2025-jst). I could finally understand the sign they give you to decide on the strength of various parts of ramen, so I could finally say....... "futsuu ii desu" LMFAO whateverrr, but honestly for some reason that time the ramen tasted EVEN better so like whatever changed for the ramen by just saying mid for everyhting is fine was honestly good as fuck. Didn't take a pic becuase the ramen basically looked the same as before lol, though the pork piece was bigger

<b>I ALSO STARTED DRAWING!!!!</b> I'm gonna try drawing for about 1-2 hours everyday now. The shit is way too ass for me to post it publicly, but hopefully I can get good enough to just start posting them out there sooner than later!!!

I was going to start drawing way sooner, but the nib for my apple pencil went missing. I was also way too lazy to like take everything out of my bag to try to find the nib by just shaking it hoping it fell, so I ended up delaying my start on drawing... lol it's ok though because I finally did it the day before, and started drawing this day, so it's epic

# April 23 2025 JST
*Written at April 24 23:52 UTC*

THE ELEVATOR WAS DOWN AT THE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL but it was fine it was apparently fixed after like an hour or 2 lol. They also have more than one elevator so I'm just saying all that for no reason. Had breakfast from 7/11 because I was kind of running late to university (got out at like 9:20) and it was some good food. Convenience stores when good food.

Also finally tried the [Kinoko no Yama and Takenoko no Sato](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinoko_no_yama_vs_Takenoko_no_sato). One of the lab members brought it. I ahve to say, I'm on the side of Takenoko no Sato, it just tastes better man. Everyone around me was a Kinoko no Yama believer though unfortunately, oh well.

Making progress in projects as well. Slides basically almost finished for the presentation on the 24th, even though I honestly had just been taking a backseat for the most part since I'm juggling 2 projects at once lol. He's gonna end up doing most of the presentation, but it's not too bad I guess he's been fine spearheading it for the most part, especially considering he needs to present something at the end of his stay here.

Afterwards I went back to the cafe that I went to back at [April 16](#april-16-2025-jst), and ordered a cold cafe au lait this time, with a cheesecake too. Good food and good drinks again. This cafe is really nice man I'm totally making this like a regular visit place for myself; so chill, not many people, the ambience and vibe is sick, and the music taste the guy has is epic. Spent the entire time there drawing to pass the time, and then I went to COOP to get some food and then dipped back home.

![Cold cafe au lait and cheesecake](./sendai56.jpg)

Also tried the BOSS coffee drinks for once. They are SO fucking bad man I don't understand. They taste like those really shitty double shot energy caffeine starbucks drinks or something. I don't really give a shit about caffeine content, but I don't think it actually has a lot of caffeine, but it still tastes as dogshit as those starbucks energy drinks what the fuck man.

Accidentally ate an entire bag of the COOP snacks I bought at teh end, oh well. Can't wait for this weekend since I'll be going to Kusatsu Onsen and Tokyo!!!

# April 24 2025 JST
*Written at April 25 00:15 UTC*

Presentation happened; it was pretty chill, but I also didn't even do the presentation lol it was all just the other guy I feel bad but he doesn't really mind so idk. For most of the day it was checking the lab's supply of materials we'd need for the project, as well as going into a really clean mice lab. You gotta wear like entire PPE bodysuits and stuff: showercaps, coverings of the feet, everything. It was so exhausting for some reason standing there, it felt like the building was REALLY hot or something and I was getting dizzy and stuff. It's kinda crazy. It was cool tho very interesting area of the hospital.

Most of the lab also went out for Karaage. It was so fuckin good brah I got garlic chicken karaage, and they give you a bowl of rice with vegetables and fried chicken on top. Really fucking good. They also had a map of the world that you could put a sticker on for where you came from. I naturally had to place mine at hell LMAO

![Karaage](./sendai57.jpg)
![Map of the world in the restaurant](./sendai58.jpg)

Also went for a little walk out later that day. I had to get tickets for the shinkansen tomorrow but I wasn't sure what was the best way to go about it. In the end though I checked the station I'd ahve to transfer on, and it seemed not bad at all actually. Regardless, I bought non-reserved seats this time because I just wasn't really sure exactly; I hope I can still put my carry-on suitcase somewhere though, I believe it should be fine. Last time I took a reserved seat and stuff so I don't know if it might be any different. 

I also have to take a bus later to get to the Kusatsu Onsen, so I hope I don't get fucked there either. I think it'll probably be one of those big busses with space for suitcases and stuff though...... I hope.......

Ate some familymart sushi at night and it was honestly good as fuck. Even the convenience store sushi is better than the fuckass grocery store sushi in Canada man. How could this happen.... anyway I was drawing this night as well (yay for the streak), and I struggled way too hard this time. I was attempting to copy/ref off of [this drawing](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/129169492) (really pretty drawing btw). The first day I was drawing I wasn't really trying to break the reference image down to basic shapes, but this day and the day before I was, and it's REALLY fucking hard man. I made much more progress the day before this, but this one was so fucked I basically got barely any drawing in at teh end after like 1.5 hours.

In the end I basically did laundry and stuff so I'm fully ready for shinkansen, I really clutched it though because the laundry was happening quite late at night and I wasn't really sure if they were going to be dry for the morning lol

Anyway time for Kusatsu Onsen!!!!1

# April 25 2025 JST
*Written at April 26 04:42 UTC*

Kusatsu Onsen day!!! I didn't end up drawing this day, but it's fine because so much shit was happening this day. First thing I set out to do today was to get some coffee from a "chain" cafe here. I went to Tully's and got iced coffee and a custard french toast thing that they warmed up for me. The custard french toast was honestly really nice, but I inted myself with the black coffe. my canadian ass brain thuoght they'd add the cream and sugar but they didn't, and I didn't realize I add that myself, so I just drank it black. Honestly though it was good black coffee, but it just wasn't what I was expecting so I inted myself. Next time I go to Tully's thuogh I'll be chillin

![Tully's Coffee and Food](./sendai59.jpg)

After that I was shinkansening. Took the shinkansen from Sendai to Ueno, and then a shinkansen from Ueno to Karuizawa. During that time I was trying to work on the projects, but made very little progress. Though I also booked my hotel for the weekend in Tokyo too, so it should be chillin for the most part this weekend. Afterwards I was bussing all the way through Gunma prefecture from Karuizawa to the Kusatsu Onsen, and then walked up a bunch of stairs and high incline to get to our hotel. Funny timing becuase my friends were coming from a completely different route from Tokyo station, and we ended up at Kusatsu Onsen at almost the exact same time LOL. 

![Shinkansen and Ekiben](./sendai60.jpg)
![Flower Bed in Gunma](./sendai61.jpg) ![Gunma Scenery](./sendai62.jpg) ![Kusatsu Onsen Bus Terminal](./sendai63.jpg) ![Kusatsu Hotel](./sendai64.jpg) ![Inside of Kusatsu Hotel](./sendai65.jpg)

I have to say though that the bus ride through Gunma was fucking surreal. I saw so many things I have dreamt of and envisioned my ideal future setting being like that it just blew my mind. It was making me very sentimental about myself because it's like "wow, it acutally just already fucking exists in this world, and I am being kept away from anything like it for ridiculous reasons". It was just so sad. I hope I get good at drawing sooner or later so I can draw out some of the things I saw. I would've taken pics of what I'm talking about but things were going past too fast in the bus because of how the routing is like there.

Anyway after settling into our room, we went to an open air public onsen a little walk away from our hotel. Oh yea I didn't mention yet but the entire town smells like rotten eggs. It's entirely just because of the fact that there's SO MUCH sulfur in the water though, since the water is super rich in minerals (and sulfur)... hot spring moment loll

Onsen experience was epic as fuck. It was also entirely not what I was expecting. Somehow everything just felt so natural. I was worried about the entire process/transition towards becoming completely naked and around other people, but somehow in that process it just felt so automatic that it was like as if noone was actually naked around us.

Obviously we were all still naked and you COULD see people's genitals and ass and shit but it's like barely noticeable unless you are very actively trying to look at that shit. I think this is mostly because of the fact that when you are in the onsen, you are kind of entirely consumed by the really hot mineral water reducing your blood pressure and heart rate down to very low levels. When I was in the water it was like I was meditating almost, except that sometimes it was a bit hard to breathe with the way my blood pressure and heart were slowing down a lot lol. Also the steam and shit coming out of the water was really sick too

Afterwards we went around the town and looked around at the stuff there. At this time most of the shops were closed out, so the streets weren't super busy or anything. We were able to chill a decent lot at the town centre which has massive water streams flowing downwards to try to cool the water further for use. The smell of rotten eggs from the sulfur there is REALLY strong, but it's sick as hell. Also looked at a shrine and some of my friends decided to pray to it. Quite the chill experience just walking around the town and seeing the stuff around.

After that was the greatest moment of Japan so far. The hotel reservation included a 940583250924 course meal for a REALLY expensive looking dinner even though it wasn't even actually expensive. It started off "mid", but then it got better and better, up to the point where it was just straight up some of the best food I had EVER tasted. I actually like almost cried when dessert was brought out and ate the strawberry. Even the fucking strawberry was amazing man fuck

After that, we basically went back to our room. 2 of us went for another bath, but not all of us. I decided to also just stay in the room. After eating that amazing fucking meal, my haed started to hurt, and I still felt a bit disoriented/dizzy from the earlier bath. I decided to try to just go to sleep at this point forward, hoping that I could possibly sleep away the headache.
